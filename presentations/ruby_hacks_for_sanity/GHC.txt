ABSTRACT
On larger projects with more teammates, basic sanity can be difficult. Letâ€™s discuss code that can help. We'll go over code samples and discuss the problems that make them useful. 
These include defensive tests for your codebase, designing for data integrity, preventing common programmer oopses using automation, and other interesting snippets to make large-team and multi-team code more thoroughly tested, non-painful, and reliably non-broken.
 
AUDIENCE
The audience who will most benefit from this talk is experienced developers who are interested (or have lived through) large projects. The code samples are in ruby and the principles are generic and can be applied to Java, Scala, lisp etc projects.

OUTCOMES/CONCLUSION
Attendees will think about safeguards designed into codebases (tests and design, not defensive null checks) and learn about some existing practices for safer & saner development in complicated large codebases. 

 
PARTICIPATION STATEMENT
I intend to attend Grace Hopper 2015 and will present this talk if it is accepted. 
 
BIO
Linda is a developer. She came originally from a technical but non-programming background, then discovered programming as an enjoyable profession during the latter stages of college. Since then, she has worked as a developer and developer consultant with various companies on several large enterprise endeavors, some of them in dynamically typed languages. She has opinions on how to make this activity produce better results.
