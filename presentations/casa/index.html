                Official blurb: Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) programs are a national network of more than 900
                local
                organizations that utilize volunteers from the community to advocate for children in foster care because
                of abuse or neglect. Every child placed in foster care must have court oversight to ensure that both the
                child’s and the parents’ legal rights are protected until the child reaches a safe, permanent home,
                whether the child is returned to their home of origin or adopted. The first CASA Program was founded in
                1977 by a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle, Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children’s lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or “CASA,” is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child’s life (including the child’s biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child’s court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child’s needs.

                It’s a nonprofit which helps teams build software for other nonprofits, grow the tech community
                especially the most unrepresented parts, and provide educational opportunities for folks in tech
                regardless of a persons skill level. They also run events where those teams get together to hang out,
                onboard new volunteers, and jam on their projects.
                In December 2019 I signed up for the Ruby for Good west coast conference. I checked the “willing to be a
                tech lead” checkbox at a time when my dayjob didn’t want my glue work energy, feeling… confident.
                I had never been to a Ruby for Good event before but I had heard a lot about it. It sounded like
                something I wanted to do.
                Rfg is an registered nonprofit which finds orgs who could be helped by some software that doesn't exist
                or they can't afford, and builds it for them. All this work is done by volunteers.
                Why do volunteers- or maintainers- work on these projects?
                That's a question with a large variety of answers, and it's been on my mind a lot. I count as a
                maintainer because I maintain, and
                for CASA in particular, maintaining is about eighty percent making sure it's easy for other people to do
                the work, and
                the work includes figuring out what the work is.
                Community feelings, being part of a group, meeting the kind of people who put time into helping other
                people
                The newest batch of Ruby for Good leads started working in Feb 2020 - talking about what we wanted to
                build, building up a backlog of devvable work
                The conference got last minute remote-ified and was held remotely in June 2020.
                I paired with my co-lead Eric on the skeleton of a repo, since casa was brand new. We learned that
                naming a db table / activerecord model the word “case” makes rails unhappy.
                Very successful event, built out the majority of what we needed to launch.
                Later mini-events where entire developer teams volunteered on our codebase were also very helpful

                This may not be you! If you are big/popular project with more contributors than you want & a pack of
                paid maintainers, then this is not your problem (but turning the contributors that you have *into* the
                contributors that you *want* can work!)
                If you want more contributors than you have, you have to consciously and conspicuously invest in making
                sure that people know what to do. Office hours for people who want a human face, slack reminders for
                people who want to show up and figure it out, a good readme so people *can* figure it out, issues that
                explain what needs doing using url&screenshot&login rather than domain terms that new contributors won’t
                know
