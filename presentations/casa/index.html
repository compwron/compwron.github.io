                you can read more on the internet
                <br>
                In general, the system is not good enough- I say this because metrics on outcomes for youth in care are
                much worse than those for the general population in earned income, jail time, overall health.
                <br>
                I would like to take this moment to point out that I strongly believe that "Housing
                and health are fundamental human rights" and also a key indicator of a functioning society, a society is
                formed for the purpose of taking care of its members, especially the most vulnerable

                "The first CASA Program was founded in
                1977 by a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle, Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children‚Äôs lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or ‚ÄúCASA,‚Äù is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child‚Äôs life (including the child‚Äôs biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child‚Äôs court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child‚Äôs needs."

            <aside class="notes">
                Need more making-good-github-issues energy to feed the contributor appetite for small bites. Having a
                super active PM for the first year of the project was fantastic (thank you Zoe!)

                I make issues like please make The Button on The Volunteer Page go to The Right place. Okayyyy.... what?
                <br>
                I can't write issues for myself, I need to write issues for the people who want to solve the issues.
                <br>
                It is very valuable to have a contributor who writes tickets. I don't care if you call them a PM or a QA
                or a maintainer or a designer or a team lead, someone has to write the tickets, including key developer
                chores like
                test improvements and refactoring.

                Retaining and growing your contributors is a good investment - many of ours come in because a friend

                more contributors for you + pitching you to their friends

                This may not be you! If you are big/popular project with more contributors than you want & a pack of
                paid maintainers, then this is not your problem (but turning the contributors that you have *into* the
                contributors that you *want* can work!)
                If you want more contributors than you have, you have to consciously and conspicuously invest in making
                sure that people know what to do. Office hours for people who want a human face, slack reminders for
                people who want to show up and figure it out, a good readme so people *can* figure it out, issues that
                explain what needs doing using url&screenshot&login rather than domain terms that new contributors won‚Äôt
                know
