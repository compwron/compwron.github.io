                In general, the system is not good enough- I say this because metrics on outcomes for youth in care are
                much worse than those for the general population in earned income, jail time, overall health.
                <br>
                I would like to take this moment to point out that I strongly believe that "Housing
                and health are fundamental human rights" and also a key indicator of a functioning society, a society is
                formed for the purpose of taking care of its members, especially the most vulnerable

                "Every child placed in foster care must have court oversight to ensure that both the
                child’s and the parents’ legal rights are protected until the child reaches a safe, permanent home,
                whether the child is returned to their home of origin or adopted.

                "The first CASA Program was founded in
                1977 by a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle, Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children’s lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or “CASA,” is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child’s life (including the child’s biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child’s court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child’s needs."

                Why do volunteers- or maintainers- work on these projects? That's a question with a large variety of
                answers, and it's been on my mind a lot. I have foudn that for me, maintaining is about eighty percent
                making sure it's easy for other people to do the work, and the work includes figuring out what the work
                is. this may or may not be your experience of maintainership.
                <br>
                Why do volunteers show up and put up with me, with this? Community feelings, being part of a
                group, meeting the kind of people who put time into helping other people
                <br>
                The conference got last minute remote-ified and was held remotely in June 2020.
                I paired with my co-lead Eric on the skeleton of a repo, since casa was brand new. We learned that
                naming a db table / activerecord model the word “case” makes rails unhappy.
                Very successful event, built out the majority of what we needed to launch.
                Later mini-events where entire developer teams volunteered on our codebase were also very helpful

                This may not be you! If you are big/popular project with more contributors than you want & a pack of
                paid maintainers, then this is not your problem (but turning the contributors that you have *into* the
                contributors that you *want* can work!)
                If you want more contributors than you have, you have to consciously and conspicuously invest in making
                sure that people know what to do. Office hours for people who want a human face, slack reminders for
                people who want to show up and figure it out, a good readme so people *can* figure it out, issues that
                explain what needs doing using url&screenshot&login rather than domain terms that new contributors won’t
                know
