                I have been a developer since 2010. For a while I was a consultant, and I've worked in a variety of
                industries including airlines and payment processing, and now I work in healthtech.
                I work in healthtech because I have figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life, which by the
                way is terrifying- I plan to spend my foreseeable future taking my revenge upon the USA healthcare
                system
                by trying to improve it.

                My open-source-supportive employer is Parachute Health. They help patients get their prescribed

                <br>

                <br>
                These youth are ages zero thru eighteen (or twenty-one, depending on circumstances) who are not under

                "Every child placed in foster care must have court oversight to ensure that both the
                child‚Äôs and the parents‚Äô legal rights are protected until the child reaches a safe, permanent home"

            <p style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: left">
                "The first CASA Program was founded in 1977 by Judge David Soukup, a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle,
                Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children‚Äôs lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or ‚ÄúCASA,‚Äù is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child‚Äôs life (including the child‚Äôs biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child‚Äôs court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child‚Äôs needs."
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Fifty years ago in the seventies there was a judge who felt that he didn't know enough about the
                situations of foster youth to make informed decisions about their care. Decisions like
                who the legal guardian of the youth will be and what the rules around visitation
                are. To fix this, he created the organization that grew into CASA.

                Today, CASA is a national organization with many local chapters, corresponding to the organization of
                the courts where the volunteers serve. Over ninety thousand volunteers in almost all states, each go
                through
                over thirty hours of training plus ongoing continuing education. They are sworn in by a judge and commit
                to serve for several years. Each volunteer is assigned to one youth- sometimes two when there are
                siblings- and follow up on the youth's care by talking to everyone involved.
                Some volunteers are law students, some are retired, and they are very good at what they do, but doing
                the paperwork is sometimes hard.
                The court report is due every six ish months depending on court schedule, and has a specific format.

                How do they do what they do, currently?
                A CASA volunteer communicates with the youth, parents, health professionals, teachers, and many others.
                They take notes and help with reminders and accountability.
                There are several supervisors per CASA organization.
                They help the volunteer
                craft the court report and keep up with the youth's situation.
                Volunteers are unpaid but
                can sometimes get mileage reimbursements.
                The volunteer attends ongoing training on a regular basis.
                The volunteer's notes, if they have been submitted to the CASA organization through the supervisor, are
                useful contributing documentation when CASA organizations are providing evidence for their usefulness,
                like when applying for grants.

                What is ruby for Good? Who are WE? How do WE help?
                <br>
                There have been many Ruby for Good projects- some of the currently active ones are (TODO update names
                during conference)
                Human Essentials, Terrastories, Chicago Tool Library, Mutual Aid, Abalone, and CASA! You can see more
                historical projects at this Impact link.
                <br>
                Ruby for Good want to grow the tech community broader than it otherwise would be,
                by helping people in, especially people from groups who are typically unrepresented in the tech
                community, and regardless of skill level! Again, regardless of skill level!
                <br>
                We host two yearly events, where people can show up, contribute to one or many projects, hang out and be
                social with other contributors, pair program, and feel inspired.

                How did Ruby for Good and CASA meet up? A former CASA volunteer joined Ruby for Good and said-
                hey, I know some people who could use some software...
                <br>
                I came in, in 2019 when I signed up for the conference. I checked the box that said are you willing to
                be a Tech Lead- I felt confident. I was assigned to CASA.
                We did a lot of planning, stakeholder discussions, UI mockups, database schema design...
                <br>
                Then 2020 came and we had a surprise remote conference!
                It went very well actually, in large part ot the Zoom management skills of our PM Zoe,
                the flexibility of our attendees, some spreadsheets, and tech leads rotating between zoom breakout rooms
                to check in on pairs. So what did we build?

                The webapp is fully responsive for mobile, so that volunteers can easily use it from whatever device
                they have with them, in whatever place they are. We have an Android app which is a thin shell over our
                responsive webview.

                This is the most important page in the app, where a volunteer enters a case contact.
                A case contact is when the volunteer talks to someone about the youth's case.
                These categories and contact types are fully customizable for each CASA organization and for each case-
                for example, a youth might not have a sibling, so a supervisor would de-select Sibling from the contact
                type list for this case, so that the volunteer can look at their contact checklist without distractions.
                <br>
                Contact made means- did they pick up the phone, did they answer the door.

                Here is the second half of the most important page, and the most important field on the most important
                page, which is notes. Notes in production average 400 - 1000 words. The vast majority of all case
                contacts have notes.

                Some highlights-
                The butterfly emoji is a visual representation of a transition aged youth- i.e. teenaged.
                The Court Mandates are front and center- those come from the judge.
                Up top, there's a button to generate the court report document.
                There is also a button linking to the Emancipation Checklist-
                emancipation is where you age out of the foster care system, containing things like- does the youth have
                a drivers license? Do they have a place to stay?
                A supervisor can send an email reminder to a volunteer through the website. or an in-app notification

                Import is one of the technically trickier parts of the system. It's used for importing all the
                supervisors, volunteers, and cases when a new CASA joins the system, and when a new batch of CASA
                volunteers complete training, are sworn in, and are assigned to youth cases. They can also be added one
                at a time but this is more
                efficient for streamlining onboarding.
                <br>
                I highly recommend the UI pattern of- if you need a user to upload a file in a partiularformat, give
                them a downloadable file in taht same format for them to follow and fill in. Also very cool, when an
                error occurs with a line of an uploaded file here- like a duplicate or invalid data- then the user gets
                a downloaded file with line by line errors that they can edit and re-upload.

                Fast merge, increases contributor stickiness. People stick around because they feel their work is
                valued.
                Cultural expectation when a PR is merged but with some comments on style and testing is to
                open a new PR addressing those comments
                <br>
                Lead merges, improves velocity and reduces chances of conflicts. Started during onsite conferences,
                continued because we like the way it feels. Not all r4g projects do that, just us.
                <br>
                merge is safe because our deployment pipeline gates between merge and production

                Learning to write new tests is a skill that many new contributors value and want to practice.

                Case numbers are meaningful. When we show data to our Subject Matter Experts, SMEs, it's important that
                the data be realistic because many SMEs are hyper-sensitive to invalid or unrealistic data. For example,
                occasionally one of our users points out that in our test data, a case with a number starting in 00
                should have emancipated by now, and a case with a YY field of 20 cannot reasonably be a transition aged
                youth because they are 1 year old, not a teenager.
