                I have been a developer since 2010. For a while I was a consultant, and I've worked in a variety of
                industries including airlines and payment processing, and now I work in healthtech.
                I work in healthtech because I have figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life, which by the
                way is terrifying- I plan to spend my foreseeable future taking my revenge upon the USA healthcare
                system
                by trying to improve it.

                My open-source-supportive employer is Parachute Health. They help patients get their prescribed

                <br>
                I have been a lead on the CASA project since it started in 2019.

                These youth are ages zero thru eighteen (or twenty-one, depending on circumstances) who are not under

                "Every child placed in foster care must have court oversight to ensure that both the
                child’s and the parents’ legal rights are protected until the child reaches a safe, permanent home"
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em; text-align: left">
                "The first CASA Program was founded in 1977 by Judge David Soukup, a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle,
                Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children’s lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or “CASA,” is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child’s life (including the child’s biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child’s court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child’s needs."
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Fifty years ago in the seventies there was a judge who felt that he didn't know enough about the
                situations of foster youth to make informed decisions about their care. Decisions like
                who the legal guardian of the youth will be and what the rules around visitation
                are. To fix this, he created the organization that grew into CASA.

                Today, CASA is a national organization with many local chapters, corresponding to the organization of
                the courts where the volunteers serve. Over ninety thousand volunteers in almost all states, each go
                through
                over thirty hours of training plus ongoing continuing education. They are sworn in by a judge and commit
                to serve for several years. Each volunteer is assigned to one youth- sometimes two when there are
                siblings- and follow up on the youth's care by talking to everyone involved.
                Some volunteers are law students, some are retired, and they are very good at what they do, but doing
                the paperwork is sometimes hard.
                The court report is due every six ish months depending on court schedule, and has a specific format.

                How do they do what they do, currently?
                A CASA volunteer communicates with the youth, parents, health professionals, teachers, and many others.
                They take notes and help with reminders and accountability.
                There are several supervisors per CASA organization.
                They help the volunteer
                craft the court report and keep up with the youth's situation.
                Volunteers are unpaid but
                can sometimes get mileage reimbursements.
                The volunteer attends ongoing training on a regular basis.
                The volunteer's notes, if they have been submitted to the CASA organization through the supervisor, are
                useful contributing documentation when CASA organizations are providing evidence for their usefulness,
                like when applying for grants.

                What is Ruby for Good? Who are WE? How do WE help?
                <br>
                There have been many Ruby for Good projects- some of the currently active ones include:
                Human Essentials, Terrastories, Circulate Tool Library for Chicago and beyond, Shelter Assist, Mutual
                Aid, Abalone, and others!
                You can see more historical projects at this Impact link.
                <br>
                Ruby for Good want to grow the tech community broader than it otherwise would be,
                by helping people in, especially people from groups who are typically unrepresented in the tech
                community, and regardless of skill level! Again, regardless of skill level!
                <br>
                We host two yearly events, where people can show up, contribute to one or many projects, hang out and be
                social with other contributors, pair program, and feel inspired.

            <ul>
                <li>A former Prince George County (MD) CASA volunteer joined Ruby for Good</li>
                <li>2019 - I signed up for a conference!</li>

            <aside class="notes">
                How did Ruby for Good and CASA meet up? A former CASA volunteer joined Ruby for Good and said-
                hey, I know some people who could use some software...
                <br>
                I came in, in 2019 when I signed up for the conference. I checked the box that said are you willing to
                be a Tech Lead- I felt confident. I was assigned to CASA.
                We did a lot of planning, stakeholder discussions, UI mockups, database schema design...
                <br>
                Then 2020 came and we had a surprise remote Ruby for Good conference!
                It went very well actually thanks to the flexibility of the attendees, and some spreadsheets,
                and lots of Zoom breakout rooms for pair programming.
                So what did we build?

                This is the most important page in the app, where a volunteer enters a case contact.
                A case contact is when the volunteer talks to someone about the youth's case.
                These categories and contact types are fully customizable for each CASA organization and for each case-
                for example, a youth might not have a sibling, so a supervisor would de-select Sibling from the contact
                type list for this case, so that the volunteer can look at their contact checklist without distractions.
                <br>
                Contact made means- did they pick up the phone, did they answer the door.

                Up top, there's a button to generate the court report document.
                There is also a button linking to the Emancipation Checklist-
                emancipation is where you age out of the foster care system, containing things like- does the youth have
                a drivers license? Do they have a place to stay?

                Import is one of the technically trickier parts of the system. It's used for importing all the
                supervisors, volunteers, and cases when a new CASA joins the system, and when a new batch of CASA
                volunteers complete training, are sworn in, and are assigned to youth cases. They can also be added one
                at a time but this is more efficient for streamlining onboarding.
                <br>
                We have a great UI pattern. If you need a user to upload a file in a partiular format, give
                them a downloadable file in taht same format for them to follow and fill in. Also very cool, when an
                error occurs with a line of an uploaded file here- like a duplicate or invalid data- then the user gets
                a downloaded file with line by line errors that they can edit and re-upload.

                Our users love our UI because it is simple, and user friendly, and has nothing that they don't

                (Why do volunteers volunteer?) Why do contributors contribute?
                This is on my mind a lot.
                <br>
                Our contributors each have their own reasons. Some themes I see are- they want to learn, they want to
                learn by doing. They want to contribute to something, and they want to learn how to contribute to
                something. They want to "DO" open source software, because everyone should DO open source software- the
                zeitgeist says so, the zeitgeist requires it. All developers know that you should do open source work.
                <br>
                And- our contributors want to meet the kind of people who want to help people.

                So why do maintainers maintain? And how? For me, most of what I do is making it easy for other people to
                do work. I love other people doing work.
                <br>
                I like coding, I do it for work and I do it for fun. When I want extra fun I do it for CASA, but that's
                not the
                core value I provide. The core value that I provide is encouragement and being a safety net.
                I say- "It's ok if the PR is bad, if it's really bad I won't merge it. We'll improve it together. You
                should open that PR. Ask in slack if you have questions- there's always someone around.
                Yes that looks like a bug, you should make an issue for it.

                I've been editing and reading the same document since 2019, which is an unusual feeling.
                The stakeholders also enjoy sharing best practices with each other and listening to them helps us

                Another useful technique is a smart bug reporting form made by a previous PM that guides the user to
                make a clear bug report and then auto-posts to a private slack channel (because users can type anything
                into a form...)

                ✅ Cadence and breaks

                Having a regular cadence for important tasks makes them easy to remember for everyone.
                We skip one now and then for special events.
                <br>
                We have weekly office hours on the same day as the stakeholder sync, which is convenient for
                transcribing notes into coherent units of work.
                <br>
                Office hours are casual and social- we usually debug something, and discuss upcoming work and events,
                and co-work.
                <br>
                We deploy weekly on friday evenings because frequent deploys are safer than infrequent big deploys, and
                if something goes wrong we have more contributors available to take a look at it than during the work
                week.
                <br>
                We have chill times between big events which is great- rest periods help with sustainability.

                Speaking of big events, Ruby for Good's East coast event happened last week near DC.
                At events like these, new joiners pick a project and make great contributions while enjoying
                pair programming (optional but popular) and non-coding social events also.
                These development sprints help us make enormous progress and set us up for success.
                Most contributors choose one project to work on, but some try to get one PR into every project
                which is fun too.

                We have a bot channel for PRs, issues, bugsnag errors, and heroku deploys. It's noisy and a good

                Dependabot opens PRs to keep your dependencies up to date, which is much better than ignoring them until
                you need to upgrade and something strange broke long ago.
                <br>
                We use github Projects for work management in a vaguely kanban style, and newly created issues auto-add
                themselves to the board. It's simple but you can automate it, and it's nice to not need an extra login
                for contributors to look at to claim an issue.
                <br>
                Workflows ticket management to comment on and then unassign claimed but inactive issues reduces
                repetitive emotional labor. Workflows also auto-tag our new issues
                <br>
                We use github wiki for project-level information on processes and historical record
                <br>
                PR templates and issue templates are great to gently guide contributors to give you essential
                information.

                <li>🌳 Branches - maintainer-merger convenience</li>
                <li>🍴 Forks - more educational</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                No one should be able to force-push to your main branch. If you really need to, remove the permission
                blockage, do the needful, and then put your protective gear back on.
                <br>
                I prefer contributors to branch rather than forking when possible because that makes it easy for a
                maintainer to push to a branch to
                clean up PR issues pre-merge. In order to enable branching over forking, we give excessive permissions
                to contributors who made made a fwe PRs or come to office hours.
                <br>
                However, forking teaches contributors how to contribute in general. Git is one of the hard parts of
                getting
                started in OSS

                When a PR is merged, it automatically deploys to the QA environment.
                Then there is a button in heroku to press to manually deploy to staging, and from there to prod.
                <br>
                Deploying to staging shortly before prod gives us a chance to see migrations and data migrations run
                together realistically rather than piecemeal. Because code that deployed together successfully does not
                always deploy successfully together.
                <br>
                We have a deploy checklist, which includes checking on db backups and email bounce rates.

                We have code. We have lots of tests, because our only defence against ourselves is tests.
                A PR without sufficient testing may be merged, but we'll ask the contributor for a follow-up PR with
                improvements, or file a chore to add more tests.

                Fast merging increases contributor stickiness. We need contributor stickiness!
                People stick around because they feel their work is valued.
                cultural expectation: maintainer approves and merges. Requests changes in follow-up PR or create chore.
                Reduces chances of merge conflicts. We started doing it during conferences, and
                continued because we like the way it feels. Not all r4g projects do that, just us.
                This is extra safe because merging does not equal deploying.
                Learning to write new tests is a skill that many new contributors value and want to practice.

            <p>❌ More issues, please!</p>
            <p>Small bites 🍪</p>

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                Unlike many other open source projects, the majority of our issues are created by maintainers based on
                discussions with stakeholders. Which takes work. We go through a few issues a week during regular weeks,
                and we run out of 150+ issue backlogs during big events.
                <br>
                This is a great problem to have, but it is still a problem that we have.
                <br>
                We have a strong contributor appetite for small bites and intro issues.
                <br>
                Write issues for the people who you want to solve the issues- not yourself. When I make an issue for
                myself, it says "fix the button on the edit page" but which edit page? Which button? What does fix mean?

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                Safety nets like multiple maintainers, a deployment pipeline, lots of tests, a backing organization like
                ruby for good, cross-talk with other projects. Safety nets allows people to move faster.
                <br>
                Clear priorities reduce total effort. talk about why you do things like have a deployment pipeline, or
                why you have specifically Word docs. Arbitrary decisions and requirements are a transparency problem.
                <br>
                Cadence and breaks are key (for me). Your mileage may vary. Multiple maintainers are great to have.
                <br>
                I hope you have liked this case study.

                Case numbers are meaningful. When we show data to our Subject Matter Experts, SMEs, it's important that
                the data be realistic because many SMEs are hyper-sensitive to invalid or unrealistic data. For example,
                occasionally one of our users points out that in our test data, a case with a number starting in 00
                should have emancipated by now, and a case with a YY field of 20 cannot reasonably be a transition aged
                youth because they are 1 year old, not a teenager.
