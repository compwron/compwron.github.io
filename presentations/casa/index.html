                "The first CASA Program was founded in
                1977 by a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle, Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children’s lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or “CASA,” is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child’s life (including the child’s biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child’s court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child’s needs."

                retention. Cultural expectation when a PR is merged but with some comments on style and testing is to
                open a new PR addressing those comments

                merge is safe because our deployment pipeline gates between merge and production

                Some maintainers could theoretically build it all themselves, for a while at least.
                But that’s not what I want for my time, flexibility, and mental health.
                If you want more contributors than you have, you have to consciously and conspicuously invest in making
                sure that people know what to do. Office hours for people who want a human face, slack reminders for
                people who want to show up and figure it out, a good readme so people *can* figure it out, issues that
                explain what needs doing using url+screenshot rather than domain terms that new contributors won’t
                know

                CR- put most common first
                We want more CASA regions on the platform- if you know someone who is involved in the foster care system

                Constant shortage of PM/QA/design. Come contribute as a developer, designer, project manager, or
                whatever you skills are -- we’ll find you
                something to do
                <br>
                We could *especially* and *always* use more people who are willing to write github issues about the
                future work we want to do.
                <br>
                And of course, we welcome pull requests for new features, refactoring, and improving our test suite.

                Case numbers are meaningful. When we show data to our Subject Matter Experts, SMEs, it's important that
                the data be realistic because many SMEs are hyper-sensitive to invalid or unrealistic data. For example,
                occasionally one of our users points out that in our test data, a case with a number starting in 00
                should have emancipated by now, and a case with a YY field of 20 cannot reasonably be a transition aged
                youth because they are 1 year old, not a teenager.
