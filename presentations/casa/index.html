                "The first CASA Program was founded in
                1977 by a Juvenile Court judge in Seattle, Washington who felt that he was making critical decisions
                about children‚Äôs lives without adequate information. He began recruiting volunteers from the community
                to work one-on-one with children in foster care. The volunteer advocate, or ‚ÄúCASA,‚Äù is appointed by a
                juvenile court judge to a child in foster care. The CASA then gets to know their assigned child, gathers
                information from everyone in the child‚Äôs life (including the child‚Äôs biological parents, foster parents,
                medical and mental health professionals, social workers, therapists, teachers, and attorneys) and
                prepares a written report giving the judge in the child‚Äôs court case detailed information about the
                situation and the child‚Äôs needs."

                Fast merge, ppl stick around because they feel their work is valued. Contributor stickiness i.e.
                retention. Cultural expectation when a PR is merged but with some comments on style and testing is to
                open a new PR addressing those comments

                Lead merges, improves velocity and reduces chances of conflicts. Started during onsite conferences,
                continued because we like the way it feels.
                <br>
                merge is safe because our deployment pipeline gates between merge and production
                <br>
                Learning to write new tests is a skill that many new contributors value and want to practice.

                Redundancies in people- build your flexibility. We have lots of rescuers even when we have very few day

                A safety net / backing organization is wonderful for many reasons, including negotiating on your behalf
                for free services, + hard-won knowledge
                <br>
                Be aware that your purpose as a project (may) be more than making a working tool for some users. Our
                purpose is also to help people learn how to contribute, and I consider it equally important. I could
                theoretically (for a while at least) build it all myself but that‚Äôs not what I want (time, flexibility,
                mental health)

                But that‚Äôs not what I want for my time, flexibility, and mental health.
                If you want more contributors than you have, you have to consciously and conspicuously invest in making
                sure that people know what to do. Office hours for people who want a human face, slack reminders for
                people who want to show up and figure it out, a good readme so people *can* figure it out, issues that
                explain what needs doing using url+screenshot rather than domain terms that new contributors won‚Äôt
                know

                Case numbers are meaningful. When we show data to our Subject Matter Experts, SMEs, it's important that
                the data be realistic because many SMEs are hyper-sensitive to invalid or unrealistic data. For example,
                occasionally one of our users points out that in our test data, a case with a number starting in 00
                should have emancipated by now, and a case with a YY field of 20 cannot reasonably be a transition aged
                youth because they are 1 year old, not a teenager.
