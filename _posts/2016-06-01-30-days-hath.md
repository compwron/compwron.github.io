Today was my "30 day checkin" at my new place of employment. Technically it was 37 days. It's been pretty great. I have the huge advantage of knowing the ins and outs of the company and having lots of friends and acquaintances. They trust me to get stuff done. I get leeway. So far things are pretty great. There is travel and there are weird code problems and strange food.

{% highlight ruby %}
a = Time.new(2016, 4, 25)
 => 2016-04-25 00:00:00 -0500
b = Time.now
 => 2016-06-01 15:18:48 -0500
(b - a) / (60 * 60 * 24)
 => 37.63806638133102
 {% endhighlight %}
