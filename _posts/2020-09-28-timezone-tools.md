I, like many people, have teammates in multiple timezones. Here are some tools to make it easier to know what time it is, where. 

1. [worldtimebuddy](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)
1. [Clocker (OSX)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clocker/id1056643111?mt=12) (You can change the labels for timezones- setting them to peopleâ€™s names could be helpful)
1. [spacetime.am (web or OSX)](https://spacetime.am) integrates with slack
1. [timeanddate](https://www.timeanddate.com/) Create a bookmark with the ID's of the locations you want and remove the iso value so it automatically uses the current time.
1. [World Clock Pro (OSX)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-clock-pro/id858446756?mt=12)
1. [timezone.io](https://timezone.io/)
1. [Manu World Time (OSX)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/menu-world-time/id1446377255?mt=12)
