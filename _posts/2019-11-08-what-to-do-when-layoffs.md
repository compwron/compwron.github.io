This is not currently happening to *me* but it's on my mind for reasons, so here we go:

1. Give LinkedIn recommendations to the people who were let go
1. Start a group chat- Slack is a good tool for this because it's free and common
1. Do research to find out what employee resources are available (counseling etc) and make sure to broadcast that info
1. Consider BCC emailing everyone you've worked with and plain asking them help theyâ€™d like
1. Introduce people to other people
1. Offer to review resumes
1. Offer to tweet people's linkedin profiles and retweet their need-job tweets
