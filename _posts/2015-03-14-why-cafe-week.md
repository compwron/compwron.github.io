For people (including myself) who are curious about the motivations behind using a week of vacation in order to code rather than, say, tour Europe, or visit family, or watch Netflix, or do Every Tourist Thing in SF, or go to Disneyland, hike the Appalachian Trail, etc. etc... If you do not feel that the Cafe Week posts make this clear, please [peruse this code snippet](https://github.com/compwron/cafe_week/blob/master/lib%2Fresponse.rb) (you may also want to examine [the unit tests](https://github.com/compwron/cafe_week/blob/master/spec%2Fresponse_spec.rb)).
