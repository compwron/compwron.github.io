Submitted [a talk](http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/1642) to opensourcebridge

Did the [Anagram](http://exercism.io/submissions/4d17bbdcbd6b40c7abb0bdd80f268941) exercise on exercism.io

Continued work on [pair_see](https://rubygems.org/gems/pair_see) and pushed it to rubygems. Then pushed version 0.1.1 that can be used (fixed scoping issues). Pushed [example repo](https://github.com/compwron/example_pair_see_use) that uses pair_see.

Other life stuff involving camera equipment, household maintenance.
