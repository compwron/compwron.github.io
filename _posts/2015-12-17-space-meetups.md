Some dude tries to tell me that [D3](http://d3js.org/) was a language. I did look it up to make sure that there isn't a language named D3 but I didn't find it. I think he's just kind of confused about javascript. So that was a promising start. The food was good- gyros and baklava

The door panel is a pain in the ass to get in, even with the post-it instructions.
