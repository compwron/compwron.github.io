I know that I speak from a position of enormous privilege. It makes me a little nervous. I've seen other people write "I am now available for jobs" posts and I want to help myself think about the whole topic, and there's nothing quite as thourough at making one think through something, than to think about what others will think of it.

Everything here is negotiable. It is concievable (although not likely) that I would leave my apartment, move to Alaska or Egypt, and live on someone's couch for a new job.


## Money and Stuff

- I live in San Francisco; people with my nominal skillset are routinely paid ridiculous amounts. I would very much mind being paid less than my equally skilled coworkers.
- Equity, shares, etc are bs. I will do excellent work regardless of whether I have "skin in the game" as they say.


## Coworkers

- Bros might be allergic to me.
- Having done it several times, I prefer to not be the only female engineer on a team. If you have no female engineers, why not? What do the people who don't work for you know that I don't know?


## Awesome stuff

- New code languages
- Pair programming
- Test driven development
- Spacecraft/healthcare/finance/construction domains are currently the most interesting to me
- 401ks are important
- Diverse teams


## Nuisances

- I think of year-end bonuses as bullshit and if you have them I will make my skeptical face.
- If you don't have automated tests and unit tests, I will try to add them. If you don't want them, we probably won't get along.
- Lack of pair programming. I've done a lot of solo development recently and it can be great, but pair programming can be enormously better.


## Dealbreakers

- It's gotta be salaried. I am not ready for freelance life or hourly incentives
- If your company builds weapons, we won't get along.
- Gotta have that health and dental insurance


## Location

- San Francisco, easily accessible via public transit and/or bicycle
- But that could change


## Start and End

- I probably want to start in a month or two- around April or May 2016. I am currently employed at a slowly-sunsetting startup, so I have runway to wait and choose.

## Why am I looking?

- [BuzzFeed article](http://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/more-layoffs-hit-groupons-restaurant-software-unit#.iwqaK00lGJ) (TL;DR my company is being sunsetted)


## Hunt status

- As of 9 March: Some phone interviews, some Hired stuff, intro emails from friends
