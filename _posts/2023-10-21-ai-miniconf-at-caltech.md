Generative AI
The impact on the Knowledge Worker and Creative Workplace

Generative Artificial Intelligence, such as ChatGPT, represents a new IT platform that is already proving to be as much of a paradigm shift as Social Media was in the 2000’s and Smartphones were in the 2010’s. But who will it most impact and how: students, researchers, financial analysts, script writers, visual artists, or designers? Will the new implementations of AI double our productivity or half the workforce?  What are the security and privacy risks?

Join us for a keynote presentation from a leading Caltech professor followed by a panel discussion of this emerging transformation with leading researchers, business executives, investors, and entrepreneurs. That will be followed by an extended Q&A opportunity and plenty of networking.
