ACM Code of Ethics

Not over-packed keynote - 800 ppl. So far, this conf seems really good

"black people KNOW that pictures are not so great for them. It's not a surprise."

"being suppressed"

The answer to all of this is "because money and ease" but it does not have to be that way.

AUDIT OUTCOMES CONSTANTLY #rubcyconf #inadvertentAlgorithmicCruelty

What is data transparency? What is that?

algorithmic transparency

Proprietary is not the only way to win. #rubyconf "Remember when we argued for OSS in our toolkits? And we were RIGHT."

cage vs cave oops

ten-minute warning for coffee

appealing to professional pride, not "code monkey"

"uncritically reproducing systems that were biased to begin with"



adconf is still the only conference I've actually felt compfortable at. I have been to a lot of conferences.


Main room: tests
rspec-given
drying up your tests makes them more complex

Joe hallway track
Sandi - squint test
lol Joe name drops Sandi :)

Wow my mentoring is kinda fail
"When you feel the impulse to refactor your test, maybe it's the code you're testing that needs refactoring -"

Thank you, dude who told me that he thinks that women care more about bring camera ready. I loved your overgeneralization. It really added to the conversation.
It is not my job to unfuck your worldview.

not so rational programmer (*step)

mere exposure effect

If you are in a position of power, delay stating your opinion until everyone else has done so, or they will migrate to your opinion before having their on. #rubyconf

cognitive biases

----

extremely defensive programming

fun and plausible solutions
"I was asked a qustion by a jr developer that absolutely floored me- that I wsn't able to give a reasonable and complete answer to. forced to expain to a great level of detail" -
when its ok to override the methods on object?

what makes a gem good?
- terrible/good internals?
- more convenient that doing it myself ... and it stays convenient
-

"Teams are not homogeneous in terms of skill! There are senior developers AND junior developers" #rubyconf

"Now I need to talk about defensive coding, and this is where it is going to get slightly mad." - @samphippen #rubyconf

Users lie. def method ; 'get' ; end

killing the method methhod by accident

TODO read rspec for fun, yes

good talk to re-watch show to the team

Some objects do not hae Kernel in their nheritence chain

"the alpha nerds in the room..."

include Kernel.dup

rebinding kernel ...?

ree

rubinius "not out of a lack of trying- on both sides"

"the rspec test suite is a great stress test for the metaprogramming of any ruby vm"


symboldelegator - in stdlib - not in kernel inheritance chain

Rebecca's talk on feature flags

reading slides?

simplistic so far...

- what is a feature flag
- why use it?
http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html

http://eventifier.com/event/rubyconf2015/


Can you say more about who turns them on and off, and how and when?
via commits

My perfect feature flag frameworks? no, but what tradeoffs

repeat the question!

Joe's talk!
"And i have flagrant time management problems, and let's talk about them and maybe we will all feel better"

joe is a good speaker! (rebecca is a stilted speaker)
"Actively disengaged- I'm not sure what that is, but it sounds like you're about to burn the building down and walk out." - @jmmastey #rubyconf

"being the child of the internet that I am..."

"I don't get enough done, I still have hobbies and interests and friends... "
"the actual tip is - just wake up earlier!" noooo
time thieves as gnimes!

"no such thing as an effective company- only an effective work group"

"self-care: you're doing it wrong"
