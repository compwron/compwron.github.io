## Overall

That's a lot of conference for $85. (I went to all 4 days). I wish I'd gotten the $150 ticket in order to be able to go to the Open Source Law training all day on Friday. The convention center was a good venue for this size of conference. There are many pleasant food places a short walk down the hill. The convention hotel was not great, but it was very near the convention center. Some of the SCALE14x talks were "amateur" vs "expert" talks, by the definition "An amateur talk tells you all the reasons that something is interesting; an expert talk tells you all that, and all the reasons why it is also a terrible idea with many attack vectors, but possibly still the best idea."

My notes below are in reverse order because that was the most convenient way for me to write them, so the first talk that I saw is at the very bottom.

Ratio: there were some women there! I'd estimate about 8% or so.

Booths: The exhibit hall has a lot of good stuff in it. The Facebook booth was the fanciest. Nagios had the best tshirts. There were 3 booths which were covered in technical books for sale. :) :)

## Sunday keynote

- Watched online / skipped. I think that this was a good recap of the relevant points.

## [Docker, Kubernetes, and Mesos: Compared.](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/docker-kubernetes-and-mesos-compared)

- "Software is a liquid. Liquids take on the shape of their container."
- [Barreleye](http://www.nextplatform.com/2015/10/19/rackspace-forges-first-barreleye-openpower-servers/) - 160 CPUs on one board.
- [Carina](https://getcarina.com/) "Carina makes container clusters more accessible to everyone, from novices to professional developers." advertisement?
- Rackspace Magnum
- Why choose Kubernetes? "If you think that Google's code doesn't stink." It is very proven in very production.

## [A Cloud-based Architecture for Processing 3D Mars Terrain](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/cloud-based-architecture-processing-3d-mars-terrain) by [Parker Abercrombie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parkerabercrombie)

- [his blog](http://pabercrombie.com/wordpress/about/)
- "NASA and Microsoft have teamed up to develop software called OnSight, a new technology that will enable scientists to work virtually on Mars using wearable technology called Microsoft HoloLens." [source](http://opslab.jpl.nasa.gov/)
- Project: OnSight- JPL + Microsoft.
- Mount Sharp- where the rover is heading.
- todo: dynamic rover path background?
- [google map mars](http://www.google.com/mars/)
- derive range from camera to each point on terrain, get point cloud, make mesh geometry, paint images onto mesh.
- Navcam (rover), HIRISE (orbiter- least good), Mastcam (color, science camera)
- In-house pieline. (audience questions)
- 430 scenes, new every day, size of image varies. 1 scene- 5gb, 1k images, 2.5hr runtime on one computer.
- bursty workload
- tools: jenkins, ansible, loopback(nodejs), angular, Bootstrap, amazon SNS, amason SOQS, ...
- in-house build tool / build manager
- automate jenkins with groovy scripts
- GPU on cloud machines is troublesome- had to fiddle a lot, didnt work like desktops.
- Spot instances! 10 cents per hour. Spot instances, not on-demand.
- more audience inturruptions
- future work: ansible to manage worker AMIs. Split pieline into smaller services. (why?), more autoscaling and management
- they want to maintain some level of cloud-independence.
- 2020 next mars rover lands, gotta be ready
- Might use [spinnaker](http://spinnaker.io/)

- "Building Oracle in LXC in Ubuntu" ksplice. The war against slides.
- Lucy Liman "GIF analysis" spelling it.  LZW lossless compression. TIL "Blue" humor is a name for Off-color/vulgar/crude. GIFs are a way to express emotion... "In order to find this, I googled shark cat roomba duck, and google totally knew what I meant." Types of humor- physical, crude, pun, (some more)
- Don Marti "Saving Advertising" [Aloodo](http://www.aloodo.org/) There are important cultural works that were paid for by advertising, and we need to let that still happen. How did we get here from there? /

- Cory Quinn "that time my boss destroyed a cubicle." "You have all heard about Docker, because the first rule of Docker is- never shut the fuck up about docker." "The first title of my talk was Docker is Horseshit, and the organizers asked me to change it, and then they asked if I wouldn't mind changing it back. " "And somewhere along here, we forgot to build roads." Hasty Pudding lol.

Notes on lightning talks.

- Mics are hard. The war to make your own slides work.

For the rest of the afternoon Friday, I wandered, rested, went to the hallway track. Went to get snacks for tomorrow, got coffee at a local place.

## Config Management Sucks (*run)

- "Thanks for coming to my group therapy session"
- [@rothgar](https://twitter.com/rothgar)

- scale, consistent (even if broken), reliability, community ("Use these tools because you will be an angry sysadmin if you don't.")
- [j.mp/cm-sucks-scale14](slides)

Fun times- before the config management talk, I talked to a dude from Procore. they have a rails monolith. Talked about plangrid, redis in use, gotta switch to resque for threading?
Deciding to turn networking mode on is pretty cool.

Friday at the end of lunch, I met some cool people. Julie(?) and Austin, and she was working on her dissertation about Doctorow and she talked to him and got a point corrected :) :)

## Thursday, 2pm, debugging Postgres

- [@jim_mlodgenski](https://twitter.com/jim_mlodgenski)
- [cto, openscg.com](http://www.openscg.com/)
- {pgconf NY](http://www.pgconf.us/2016/)
- he's using fantasy football as an example- discussed how he had to explain his premise when presenting in Europe.
- From his graph, it appears that PL/R triggers are slowest.
- Code of what he's using: [git clone git://git.postgresql.org/git/pldebugger.git](http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pldebugger.git;a=summary)
- live demo lol
- Don't put functions in where clause, unless theres an index. Will kill performance. Calculate on insertion rather than extraction. Spend once, read many times.
- How many times a record has been read? (mi)
- track_functions - populate system view pg_stat_user_functions
- "alter system set" changes the config file so that it will persist, but requires a restart to take effect
- plprofiler and pldebugger use the same hooks, and only one of them can run at a time.
- I asked a question! How often you have to change it so it won't break, how to test the new versions... looks like very academic software.
- [plprofiler](https://bitbucket.org/openscg/plprofiler.git)

## Notes:

- [Juju](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/07/15/continuous-integration-with-juju-and-drone-ci/)
- Todo me- implement a tiny code debugger from scratch- in ruby, for ruby? p timestamp right before, after each line, with line number. _line num A for before, B for after, timestamp"
- Chef room was very full
- Always use long options in automation, never short ones. short ones are for interactive mode. Because it's easier to read. (this could be a blog post) -n is --bindir in Gem (as in gem install), people rarely use long options for rsync but should!. Also "test" - in bash scripts has no long options "because fuck you, that's why"

## Facilities

- Power in strung under every few rows of chairs in the talk rooms. :)
- Wifi worked well!
- Hotel gave me a not-great room which was also not what I asked for and called it an upgrade because it has a noisy balcony that other people can see into. Also then the pipes int he bathroom leaked a lot and made the floor wet. I got a partial refund.
