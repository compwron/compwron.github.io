Today I submitted a [talk proposal](https://compwron.github.io/presentations/ruby_hacks_for_sanity/GHC.txt) to [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2015](http://gracehopper.org/call-for-participation/technology-zone/)

I have been submitting talk proposals without extensive preparation (mostly the same talk proposal several times) because the first step to doing something well is to do something horribly, and the first step to doing something horribly is to do it at all. Doing talks at conferences is good resume material and good work bragging rights and also it makes me more likely to do something that I enjoy (go to conferences) in part because presenters are frequently paid to go to conferences, or at least compensated for it.
