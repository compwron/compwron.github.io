The purpose of this post is to collect and collate information about companies which have on-site or near-site daycare. This post is focusing on daily-use daycare and mostly ignoring "backup care" and "elder care". Please feel free to contact me at [@compiledwrong](https://twitter.com/compiledwrong) with more information about these companies or other companies! Please feel free to use this information with or without crediting this post as a source.

Details which I would like to capture for each company:

- Company name
- Childcare name:
- Any affects on company retention of women:
- Capacity of daycare center:
- Waiting list length:
- Cost of use for employee:
- Provider:

## Benefits to onsite childcare

# Employee recruiting & retention
Childcare is often expensive and inconvenient in the USA. This is a benefit which is a hige incentive for parents.

# Diversity
Patagonia says that their provided childcare has helped them bring more women into management.

# Tax Benefits
The federal government recognizes the value of on-site child care to both working parents and the economy, and grants a qualified child-care program a yearly tax credit of $150,000. In addition, the government allows a company to deduct 35% of its unrecovered costs from its corporate tax bite.
