The purpose of this post is to collect and collate information about companies which have on-site or near-site daycare. This post is focusing on daily-use daycare and mostly ignoring "backup care" and "elder care". Please feel free to contact me at [@compiledwrong](https://twitter.com/compiledwrong) with more information about these companies or other companies! Please feel free to use this information with or without crediting this post as a source.

Details which I would like to capture for each company:

- Company name
- Childcare name:
- Any affects on company retention of women:
- Capacity of daycare center:
- Waiting list length:
- Cost of use for employee:
- Provider:

## Benefits to onsite childcare

# Employee recruiting & retention
Childcare is often expensive and inconvenient in the USA. This is a benefit which is a hige incentive for parents.

# Diversity
Patagonia says that their provided childcare has helped them bring more women into management.

# Tax Benefits
The federal government recognizes the value of on-site child care to both working parents and the economy, and grants a qualified child-care program a yearly tax credit of $150,000. In addition, the government allows a company to deduct 35% of its unrecovered costs from its corporate tax bite.

Re: Does Disneyland RESORT in California have daycare for their cast members?

Disneyland Resort does not offer daycare on property, nor does it make any accomodations for parents who need to get kids to or from daycare. Once you park your car in the CM parking lots and walk to the shuttle you need to be ready to clock in and work your scheduled shift. And any Disneyland Resort shift scheduled for less than 8.5 hours can be mandatorily extended at any time during your shift without prior notice (although the Lead and/or Managers goal is to give you at least 2 hours notice that your shift has just been extended out to a full 8.5 hours)

Walt Disney World, on the other hand, has two different daycare facilites on property designed especially for Cast Members and the logistics of being a Cast Member. They are operated for Disney by the YMCA, and they are really small schools with playgrounds and very nice, modern facilities.

YMCA Daycare Center for Cast Member's Children at WDW




The WDW daycare is offered at extremely low rates for children of CM's; $27 per work week for up to 10 hours per day for a pre-school age child enrolled in the pre-school curriculum. Toddlers and infants cost a few dollars more per week for their more specialized care.

There is also on-site Company-subsidized daycare facilities at the Studios in Burbank and the Grand Central Creative Campus in Glendale, for children of Disney employees and Imagineers at those two Company locations.

But there is no Disney daycare facility in Anaheim, and no plans to ever build or offer anything like that in Anaheim.

There is a waiting list for the day care, you can't just get into it the day you start your job.

"By Jennifer Godwin
What can you do to attract and keep employees in the cutthroat job market of Silicon Valley? If you're Cisco Systems , you open a $10 million state-of-the-art child care center.

For years, the networking giant resisted the idea of on-site day care, largely because of the risks involved when kids get hurt and parents get litigious. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers John Chambers says CEOs of other companies--both with and without such centers--advised him against building one. But with private child care becoming scarcer and more expensive, the huge company had little choice. It was either open a center or lose employees to their families or to other companies that offer subsidized child care.

In fact, finding affordable child care in the Valley has become as hard as finding an affordable home. Care for an infant now costs $150 to $250 per week--up to $12,500 per year--and the average center has a waiting list of six months to a year, according to Silicon Valley-based Choices for Children. What's worse, many child care providers who can't make a decent living in the nation's most expensive market are getting out of the business or moving elsewhere.

"The reason we finally decided to build the center is because we found that child care providers were going out of the area rather than moving in," says Barbara Beck Barbara Beck , vice president of human resources at Cisco.

Cisco joins a growing list of companies in the area that have opened day care centers, including biotech giant Genentech , whose 2nd Generation center has been going strong since 1989, and integrated circuit company Avant! , which has dubbed its center Planet Avant!

Cisco's new center should be quite a drawing card. Built on the company's Milpitas, Calif. campus, the 55,000 square-foot facility features five courtyard play areas and will eventually support 430 children each day, with room for emergency drop-offs and older children on school holidays.

In true Silicon Valley over-the-top fashion, the new center has networked digital cameras in the wall of every classroom so techie Mom and engineer Dad can watch their little Version 2.0s at play. The center has a dedicated information technology professional to train teachers and maintain the computers, scanners and digital cameras in every classroom.

It should also be a hit with the Cisco kids, who get a hot lunch and two snacks per day, courtesy of the kindly head cook. She offers healthy bran biscuits to visitors and leaves the kitchen window open to the playground so the smell of baking bread wafts across the playground.

Cisco, which didn't get to be the world's largest technology company by wasting money, thinks that despite the heavy investment, it will save $111 million annually by retaining employees who might otherwise quit.

Cisco estimates that the existence of the center will save 1.3 million commuter miles per year now spent taking kids to and from out-of-the-way day care centers. "Plus, the employees have already figured out that with a toddler in the car you can take the carpool lane and get to work in half the time," says Roger Brown, chief executive of Bright Horizons , which will operate the center for Cisco."

"Alex Rosenthal was our first hire, and after we made her an offer, she told us that she was pregnant," said Peterson, the CEO at Pure Growth Organic. "And I said, 'So, what?'"

Rosenthal was clearly surprised that her pregnancy wasn't viewed as an issue by her employer. She was also surprised when Peterson showed her the office nursery where her own son, Drake, was being taken care of.

"It was emotionally so important for me to have my own son at the office," said Peterson. "I think it helped him grow by having a village around him of 20 adults who would just talk to him each day, let him sit in on meetings and play with him."" https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294430
" Alexandra Rosenthal, Vice President of Brand and Product Management at Pure Growth Organic, commutes to the office every day with her 14-month-old son, Max. While she works, Max hangs out with the company's on-site nanny.

"It's amazing! Max has been coming to work with me since I came back from maternity leave," says Rosenthal. "I've met so many women who've had such anxiety about going back to work after having a baby. I feel so grateful to be able to have him here with me every day."

For Rosenthal, the benefit actually makes her work harder because she feels so taken care of by her company. "I also don't have to rush home and cut my workday short to pick up Max from daycare. He's already here with me, which gives me peace of mind so that I can really focus on work," she adds.

The benefit is fully paid for by Pure Growth, which currently has 10 full-time employees. " https://allhands.managedbyq.com/article/six-strategies-to-create-a-parent-friendly-workplace

Investment banking firm Goldman Sachs opened the City of London’s first (and as yet only) on-site corporate office creche. It opened in 2003 to initially offer all employees with children 20 days free childcare a year which can be booked either in advance or on the day if there is an urgent need.

In 2010 they expanded the facility and offered working parents free use of the nursery for four weeks to support transition back to work from parental leave and then full-time paid childcare available for those who say alternative arrangements are challenging.

“There is nothing more stressful than worrying about childcare,” explains one female managing director whose son used the facility from six months to three years old. “I just couldn’t concentrate on my job if I was worried that my nanny wasn’t feeling well or she didn’t turn up on time. It was incredible to be able to have him there. I knew that he was happy – I could go down any time.”

Goldman Sachs has rolled out on-site creches in their offices in Tokyo and New York. In locations where they can’t provide a facility they try to find a local nursery that they can subsidise for employees.

The business case for providing access to nursery facilities seems compelling. According to Sally Boyle, a partner and head of Goldman Sachs’ human capital management division internationally, many senior female employees at the company were very keen to come back from maternity leave but were struggling with childcare provision. She realised then that the nursery would be an excellent retention tool.

Head into the Goldman Sachs building on London's Fleet Street and you're greeted by wall to wall marble, a bank of receptionists and a water feature. So far, so City.

But wind your way past the lifts through an anonymous fire door and you enter a world that couldn't be less corporate. The sounds, colours and laughter of a nursery.

The Goldman Sachs Children's Centre is both incongruous - and an anomaly - the only onsite childcare facility in the Square Mile. Started in 2003 to offer back up provision for staff, it takes kids between the ages of three months and 12 years old.

The expense and regulatory requirements for such a facility are the main reasons why it is unique - and peculiar to a bank with deep pockets.

According to the latest figures from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, only 5% of businesses in the UK now offer childcare in the workplace.

Anecdotally, this is almost exclusively made up of large employers because they have the money and space to allow for it. They include government departments, Royal Mail, a variety of universities, Microsoft and Toyota.

There are tax breaks for those companies that do.

The onsite childcare at Goldman Sachs takes children from three months to 12 years old
Employers who include childcare as part of the employee remuneration package, attract tax, National Insurance and reporting obligations.

However, employers that offer in-workplace nurseries don't - and they get relief for the day-to-day running and capital costs of providing the service, for example heating and lighting, and premises.

Flexible work
It might be seen as a perk now, but onsite childcare flourished in the immediate post-war years out of necessity.

A labour shortage meant that women were needed to work - and factories and mills started to offer the creches that allowed them to.

Dr Laura Paterson of Oxford University, who specialises in the history of women's employment, says that childcare provision by businesses died away in the 1950s as the need for women became less acute and the way they worked changed.

"Part-time and flexible working hours reduced the need for workplace nurseries to some extent," she says,

"Women who worked from the 1950s to the 70s tell us that they did part-time jobs when their children were young to fit around school hours. And they worked in the evening so that their partner could care for their children."

Staff at Goldman Sachs are allowed 20 days of emergency childcare a year
But what about those working full-time at Goldman? For Amanda Wong, who project manages new trades for the firm and is a mum to 12-month-old Naomi, the children's centre has been a lifesaver.

Ms Wong put her daughter into nursery the same day she returned to work, shortly after Naomi turned nine months.

"It has made me feel a lot more relaxed and mentally ready to come back to work a lot earlier than I would have and I think it helps new mums with separation guilt or anxieties about returning to work," she says.

Though she admits it's not ideal to take a one-year-old on the Tube through central London each day.

Six alternative ways to fix the childcare problem
Ishmeet Rayit, who manages the Goldman Sachs Children's Centre, tells me they have a higher staff ratio than Ofsted regulations require (one-to-two in the baby room rather than one-to-three), because they need to make children who might not be familiar with them, settle in quickly.

Of the 5,500 people who work in the office, about a quarter are registered users. Each parent at the bank gets 20 free "back-up" days to use the centre, renewed each year.

The most coveted facility in the centre is the after-school and holiday programme where the 5-12 year olds come. It's stuffed full of bilingual books and toys, showing just how multicultural the bank is.

"The kids call it an office day," Ms Rayit says. "They get taken out for lunch by their parents and they make friends here." Parents are only allowed to book 10 days of this holiday service at a time, the room can accommodate 12, and the waiting list to get in is long.

Sally Boyle, the international head of human resources at Goldman, says it is a "significant cost" to the firm - but it is worth it.

"We've definitely seen it have an impact on retention of a smallish group of women but important women who wouldn't have stayed I suspect if they hadn't been able to manage that childcare in a way that they can here," she says.

The centre is run by Bright Horizons, the largest provider of workplace nurseries in the UK. Goldman pays it a monthly management fee, and parents who need childcare beyond that paid for by the bank, deal directly with the nursery.

A spokesperson for the company says that demand for onsite care is increasing. "In today's competitive talent market, recruiting and retaining exceptional people is a high priority for organisations.

"Onsite childcare has been identified as a key factor in encouraging parents to return to work and, in turn, helping organisations to thrive".

'Chronic shortage'
But Rohan Silva, whose Second Home drop-in work spaces are planning in-house creches, says the barriers to entry today of setting up onsite childcare are enormous.

"The Ofsted accreditation process takes at least three months, and costs hundreds of pounds in registration costs and consultancy fees. In addition, there are multiple additional inspections each year, plus a chronic shortage of trained staff," he says.

Image copyrightSECOND HOME

Second Home found designing its onsite creches difficult
"Another challenge is the fact that so few architects and designers have ever designed childcare facilities, because so few are created by property developers. That means thinking from scratch the issues around access and child-friendly materials," Mr Silva says.

He believes it's a vital way of allowing more parents to work. "The UK's rate of maternal employment is 27% lower than other Western countries - making childcare more accessible will make a big difference.

"This is especially true of single parents - who are much more likely to be unemployed, and for whom access to childcare is the biggest barrier to finding work," Mr Silva adds.

A recent Institute of Directors survey backs this up. It found over half of its members think that the cost of childcare hurts careers - particularly those of women.

It is currently consulting on whether to open a creche for its members.

For now, though unlike those women working in factories after the war, the option of taking your child to work is offered at a company's largesse rather than out of compulsion. And it's reserved for a privileged few.

Colleges and universities are hit/miss (mostly miss) on on-campus childcare. From my professional groups, they seem few and far between, and are often prioritized entry by seniority and/or have

"I'm military, we have CDCs all over post that are open early and close late. There are also base-approved/certified home care providers who have their own hours/do overnights/etc."

Companies "looking into it"
Yanfeng is looking into it

Difficulties:
"There’s the cost: A 10,000-square-foot on-site center that can handle 100 kids might cost $1.7 million to $2 million to build, according to Reed Construction Data, which tracks building statistics. Then there’s the added challenge of state regulations, liability risks, and operational costs," http://fortune.com/2013/10/14/which-tech-company-offers-the-best-child-care/

Approaches:
Onsite (free or subsidised / reduced rate or not subsidised)
Childcare vouchers for
Backup/last-minute only (free or subsidised / reduced rate)


Backup=-only childcare:
- Microsoft (2018 current employee described to me her recent use of it and that it worked well, although of course having even a maximally-cetted stranger take care of your child is a little stressful) - $40 for 4 hours of last-minute in-home childcare for 2 children

Companies who notably could do it, but don't:
Facebook
Yahoo

"Overall, 7 percent of employers offer child care at the work site or nearby, according to the 2016 Society for Human Resource Management’s National Study of Employers. The report is based on surveys of a nationally representative sample of more than 900 employers. Companies including Google, Cisco, and Patagonia offer on-site care.

So does Home Depot, which relies in part on a 278-space Little Apron Academy at its corporate headquarters in Atlanta to recruit talent"

Construction is near to completion on Apple’s $5B campus in Cupertino, and the project has included many odd notes, like the insistence on not having thresholds on the floor of the doorways lest daydreaming engineers trip over them, and some weird ideas about where the bathrooms should go.

But of more significance is the omission of any daycare facilities, even as the plans include a 100,000 square foot employee gym. It’s emblematic of the notorious Silicon Valley tendency to wipe out work-life balance (a pattern often reflected in the products the industry creates); its long pattern of discrimination against older, more seasoned workers in favor of young and easily manipulated workers who’ll pull the long hours the industry relies on; and the pattern of excluding women from the workforce by failing to account for the distinctive needs of a woman workforce, including childcare.

As Quartz’s Mike Murphy explains, employer-supplied childcare is a major predictor of retention of woman employees: Patagonia introduced on-site childcare and its retention rate for female employees shot to 100%.

There is a small, vocal minority of people who believe that their use of Apple products makes them into a kind of oppressed minority, and that literally anything negative said about the company represents an irrational “hipster” hatred of the company for doing so well. They are probably in the comments on this post right now, trying their spittle-flecked darndest to demoralize anyone who creates cognitive dissonance in them about their purchasing decisions, insisting nonsensically that critics of Apple give other companies a walk on the same issues (they are not all that dissimilar from people who insist that criticizing Mozilla for going the wrong way on DRM is unfair because we don’t criticize other companies [we do] or that we never take note of the good things Mozilla does [we do]).

Companies and organizations are not intrinsic forces for good. They are good when they do good. Apple was good when it fought the FBI on decryption backdoors in their devices. It was good when it fought North Carolina on transphobic bathroom laws. It was not good when it asked the Copyright Office to continue to felonize repairing or disclosing vulnerabilities in Apple products. It was not good when it ordered its recycler to shred used Apple products to prevent the development of a secondary market in used products, when it instructed its employees to covertly change the screws in its products to lock out independent repairers, or when it sued journalists for reporting on leaks from its own employees. They were not good when they colluded with other firms to rig employment markets. They were not good when they stashed billions offshore in a massive, fraudulent tax-evasion scheme.

(For the record, Google was also not good when it did this. Nor was Amazon. Nor was Starbucks, or Ikea)

Companies aren’t our friends. Mottoes like “don’t be evil” matter only to the extent that the companies that evince them follow them. The people who work for companies can be good, even while the companies aren’t. Sometimes, badness is an emergent property of good people.

But the tactic of pointing to other companies that have done bad things when your favorite company is caught in its own misdeeds is the “But her emails!” of technology fanboyism.

It’s literally pathetic.

Bright Horizons Family Solutions, BFAM, -0.02% a provider of child-care services based in Watertown, Mass., operates 464 company-sponsored centers, including Burns’s, up from 389 in 2011. But the company’s less-expensive offerings, like backup care, are growing more rapidly, according to CEO Dave Lissy.

CELESTINA BEAKES looked like a cherub as she napped in her crib at the Country Children's Center here, a vision of serene babyhood.

Small wonder that her father, Michael, couldn't resist the impulse to pick up his 16-month-old daughter and cuddle her. ''I needed to give her a hug,'' said Dr. Beakes, a senior engineer at the I.B.M. Thomas J. Watson Research Center here.

For many working parents, Dr. Beakes's ability to look in on his daughter during the workday is an impossible dream. But with the opening of the Country Children's Center, adjoining the I.B.M. campus, this spring, Dr. Beakes and many of his colleagues can check on their children during lunch breaks or any other time during the business day by visiting the center.

The center opened in March and already has a 50-family waiting list for the 50 available slots. It is I.B.M.'s first on-site day care center in Westchester. And while Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow and several colleges offer on-site day care, the only other major corporation in the county to do so is Avon in Rye, according to the Child Care Council of Westchester.

Several corporations -- including I.B.M. at other sites -- have formed consortiums to provide child care close to their workplaces.

''In this talent war companies are engaged in, after you acquire employees, how do you keep them?'' said Ted Childs, vice president for work force diversity at I.B.M. Worldwide. ''Child care is clearly an area.

''Yorktown is one of the premier research centers, with a top-notch gathering of talent. More than half of our women executives are working mothers, and a critical objective of our strategy is not to have to make a choice between being an executive and having a family. At Yorktown, that is a message we are sending to women.

''We want to help people balance work and personal lives, to enhance the quality of both sides of the equation.''

I.B.M. owns the building and leases it to the Country Children's Center, which operates the day care program.

''We run the center, and had all the decision-making about how to organize the space,'' said Polly Peace, executive director of the center. ''We pay for the utilities, and have a lease. If the slots don't get filled by I.B.M. employees, we can have community members come in.''

An I.B.M. spokesman said the center is a way to help employees, ''but it's stopping short of going into the child care business.''

Mr. Childs said the company realized ''in the early 1980's that child care would be a major issue,'' adding that I.B.M. has spent close to $200 million since 1982 on work on the sites and on arranging referrals for dependent care services. I.B.M. itself has no liability for the center.

The center here is in an attractive white colonial-style house. There are clean, bright and well-stocked rooms for the 48 infants, toddlers and preschoolers. There are picture books and easels, arts and crafts supplies, cribs and mats for naps, a kitchen, puzzles, games, puppets and cuddly stuffed animals. The building once housed I.B.M.'s research staff, but the company converted the space for the center.

There are also two playgrounds, as well as a spacious indoor play area for rainy days. The center also runs an after-school program, complete with computer stations and activities like arts and crafts and playground time for 14 school-age children.

Monthly rates are $1,054 for babies, $900 for toddlers and $800 for preschoolers, and I.B.M. does not subsidize an employee's costs. According to the Child Care Council, the average child care fees in the county range from $900 to $1,300.

The Country Children's Center was founded in 1967 as a nonprofit day care center in northern Westchester, and now serves 400 children in the county. Besides the Yorktown site, there are two centers in Katonah and one in Bedford Hills.

The centers, which are open weekdays from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. year-round, also provide summer camps, after-school programs and special programs for school vacations and closings.

Offering appropriate child care to employees is a national concern. The Ford Motor Company has been building dozens of centers around the country that will not only provide child care, but also summer programs, tutoring and services for teenagers and older family members. J. C. Penney recently allocated $12 million to help communities start after-school programs.

Dr. Beakes's situation reflects the challenges many families face.

''Like most dual-income families, we need both incomes,'' Dr. Beakes said. ''And for most dual-income families, your option is hiring nannies or looking for family home care.''

With his wife, Joanne Beccarelli, working in Manhattan for Verizon, Dr. Beakes used to drive from his home in Yorktown to Katonah to drop off his daughter and her older brother, Reginald, at that Country Children's Center program, and then head to I.B.M., which is only six miles from his house.

Now all that driving has been eliminated.

''This has given me and my children back an hour and 20 minutes of our day,'' he said. ''The best thing would be if we could be there with her. The second best is the Country Children's Center.''

Hospitals have led the way in employer-sponsored, on-site child care. Of the approximately 1,400 such child care centers around the country, about 900 are operated by hospitals, said Diane Huggins, spokeswoman for Corporate Child Care Management Services.

A University of North Carolina study found that companies with onsite childcare centers get back 50 percent to 200 percent of the cost of operation through reduced turnover and absenteeism, as well as increased engagement and productivity.
A report by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that childcare issues directly contributed to absenteeism and late arrivals in 90 percent of companies.
A study by the Simmons College Graduate School of Management found that 93 percent of parents cite onsite childcare as important when choosing an employer and 42 percent of all employees said it was a factor when determining job offers.
A retention study conducted for Union Bank found a 2.2 percent turnover rate for employees using onsite childcare versus 9.5 percent for parents using other arrangements.

Let this sink in. “...the average cost of day care in the US — $9,589 annually — is now higher than the average cost of in-state college tuition...And...on average, it costs more than $32,000 to give birth in the US, making it more expensive than in any other country.”
