tl;dr: eBay is actually pretty good at exit interviews

On 30 Mar 2015 I recieved a call from what my phone identified as "Strategic Problems". It was an exit interview for the (parent corp) of the most-recently-left job. My last day was 6 Mar 2015. They also called me on 20 Mar 2015 but I had assumed that it were spam and didn't pick up. (First attempt 10 business days after last day; successful attempt 16 business days after last day)

It was a verbal interaction by a human who responded to my questions. It was an enjoyable interaction, surprisingly. I requested that they email my answers to me; after consulting her supervisor, she found out that it was possible and then sent it to me. 

55 questions, mostly 1-5 answers, some y/n and short answers. 

Some example question topics

- Liklihood that you'd consider returning sometime in the future, same/different position
- Various questions probably designed to elicit your opinions of your immediate manager
- Training and career development stuff
- What was your favorite thing at the company

My favorite favorite question was:
"Do you know of any compliance or integrity issues that have not been addressed with [Company] (i.e., unlawful, unethical, or
illegal behaviors) that you would like to bring to the attention of [Company]? If yes, please explain."

And my second favorite question: "Is there anything else you would like to add?"

This is dramatically different from my friend's ex-company: "Bank Companyname doesn't want me to do an exit interview. They don't want feedback. They told me that I was 'top talent' and they don't want to know why I'm leaving."

My TW exit interview was a lot less formal & shorter but did also ask the important questions. 

Summary:

* eBay: pretty darn good
* Bank Companyname: bad
* TW: good (<3)
