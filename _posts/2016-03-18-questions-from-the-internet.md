So I told the internet to feel free to ask me questions. Here is that collection.

### How to interview when you're hit with something that you don't know

Say an interviewer asks me "So, I hear that you've worked in Java a bit. Tell me about how you'd use lambdas, collectors, and concurrent maps to design a massively concurrent ticket sale system."

Moving beyond the fact that maybe this isn't the best interview question, it's at least plausibly difficult to answer.

Say that this is not a question to which I have given much thought, and not one to which I had a readily-composed answer, and I hadn't used a java lambda in production code yet and I wasn't super clear on how collections were different from other things that they could be similar or different than.

I would start with admitting that I don't know, but in a way that tells the interviewer that I am game to keep trying. "Well, that's not something I've done before. I can try to walk through it. Let's start with... concurrent maps. You only need those if you're designing the system such that..."

I would ask questions. "So when you say a java lambda, do you mean that you're passing functions around as first-class objects, or...?"

If they ask "tell me how many pingpong balls in New York City" I would probably tell them that they're not doing a good job of asking intrerview questions, because I don't believe that they can derive valuable information about how I would do at the company from my answer to that question.

What are the kinds of things that I don't know? Some technical facts. Some theories of design. And of course, things that I don't know that I don't know. One of the things that I really enjoy while being interviewed is learning. That, and talking to people about interesting things and hearing about how things are at their places; even if I don't end up there, knowing about how they do what they do is inherently interesting.



### What is a java lambda? What are java lambdas for?

That is a good question and a quick google around did not make it clear to me, and I will probably have to find out for other reasons pretty soon anyway.
