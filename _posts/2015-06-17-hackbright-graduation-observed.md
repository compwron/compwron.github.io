I would love to attend Hackbright as a student for a variety of reasons; this is deeply unlikely for a yet larger variety of reasons.

* food and drink and mingling and photograpy (I skipped)
* [Michelle Glauser](https://twitter.com/michelleglauser) 'Welcome to Alumnaehood' - singing the giftastic praises of the alum association 
* [Joel Burton](https://twitter.com/wjoelburton) [Dir. of Edu. of Hackbright](http://hackbrightacademy.com/person/joel-burton/): "what the program is like"
* A Day in the Life at Hackbright by Sarah "I drank the coolaid" "So you're going to coding bootcamp. This is crazy talk to most of the people that I know."
  * wonderful script as schedule
  * "this office had a dog. It was really nice."
  * lots of munchery orders after hours during project week
* Demos: all on one single computer. Yay!
  * Sadie Wilhelm, Pensive Passport - travel plan comparator
  * Viola, The Hunt - job finding personal tracker of in-flight applications, with notes
  * Alina Kuchinski, Skillit - person-finding and help-sharing app with location sensing. 
  * Lindsie Grizzard, ArtUp - formulae that go into how to hang the art for an exhibition, track by walls in exhibition
  * Tiffany Williams (previous PhD cancer biology), WunderLand - book discovery via geographic locations related to the book, used python Natural Language Toolkit
  * Teresa K (molecular / cellular biology), Mineralchemy - data from etsy and ebay API, Minfind (scraped), radial tree for taxonomy of minerals, mindat,org
  * Becca Powell, [Break It Up](https://github.com/bpownow/breakitup) - like billsup + expensify but fancier, with ocr. Venmo integration bpownow
  * Julie Han, roller derby stats tracker - 
  * Dana, Intonation Coach - helps you practice your intonation
  * Leslie Castillianos (nonprofit funcdraising management), Brew Day - helps you manage your beer brewing cycyle, with timers and steps, with calendar reminders!
  * Shabnam, Crime Map - 
  * Rachel, Talkalot - audio request and storage service for oral histories "when I was your age..."
  * Judy Chow (GIS technician, trying to fix the data), Mapster - travel planner avoiding backtracking, uses Yelp api
  * Emily, PricePing - texts you when amazon price goes down
  * Kiera Hall (dir. of museum services @ Museum of african diaspora), Armchair Activist - five-click challenge!, Ammado integration
  * Alexandra Persaris, eCred - credit card payment plan planner. 
* Summary of upcoming deadlines


Terrible jokes:

* What do you call eight hobbits? A Hobb-byte!
* Do you want to hear a joke about oxygen and potassium? OK
* Pirate's favorite programming language? Not R, but the C! (sea)


My favorite things:

* [BeautifulSoup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup) 
* ArtUp (a thing that I didn't know existed, that probably did not exist before, that is useful to a known albeti small set of people)
* Break It Up (useful to me personally)
* grey symbolic systems tshirt some duude was wearing

Pondering: The quality of what a person ends up beinging is related to the variety of their experiences
