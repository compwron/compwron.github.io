It's not actually a conference; it's a trade show, primarily by import.io but with room for its friends & sponsors also. It was not particularly good, but it wasn't terrible, and it would be easy to improve.

# Keynote (*sit)

Pitch for import.io, and some BS about inspiration

# How Lyft grew by 5x (*walk)

Not bad. Interview format. Cool to hear about the simulator using read prod data for new algorithms and Line before it became live.

# Data science at Etsy (*step)

Cool walkthrough of how they recommend things, and why they do.

# WhoSay (*sit)

Crappy marketing pitch, no data

# Baidu (*walk)

I missed the first part because I was checking out the workshop upstairs briefly.

# DrizzyAI (*sit)

The MC was also a presenter. He really likes a rapper and wrote a twitter bot about it.

# Only Data Scientist (*step)

I did watch it. Eh.

# Data at Netflix (*hike)

Apparently this one was great, but I had to go to work.

# GoodData

Missed it; I was at work

# 100 best restaurants on Yelp (*bike)

Apparently this one was good, but I had to go to work.

# Misfits (*sit)

Crappy long sales pitch

# Chegg: death of the Unpaid Internship (*hike)

Missed it, but friends said that it had sounded good.

# Kaggle (*hike)

Compeittion website for machine learning competitions- gets great results.

Very cool. I need to do more research. I wish there had been more discussion of algorithms rather than platforms.

# Chief Algorithms Officer (of what?) (*step)

meh

- Tshirt: "Nurses: we can't fix stupid, but we can sedate it."
- "In my dreams, the conversion rates go up on their own."
- People would design a shirt for a category of people on facebook
- "So our growth went from from amazing to what the hell is happening, and we didn't know why."
- "How in the sweet merciless chaos are they doing this?"
- Facebook graph search fb.com/graphsearch
- CollegeHumor: "targeted ads are getting creepier" and then facebook shut them down
- Great storytelling :)
- People would share the "I am awesome because I am a MyLastName" with all their family. Seems legit
- Which part of this was unethical? I'm a little confused by that part.

# Moz, Randfish (*hike)

- hat good SEO means (cool graphs)
- pogo stick" clicking into a link in a google search, then backing up and clicking another one- this means that the - irst link was not good enough, and causes it to be ranked lower.
- aving a lot of google ads on your site is a small decrement on your search results (probably not significant)
- ompetitors of moz: ahref index, e(?), similarweb
- ealth websites that link out, tend to rank better than their competitors. Restaurants have no such correlation.
- ttps as a ranking signal
