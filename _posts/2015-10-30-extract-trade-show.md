It's not actually a conference; it's a trade show, primarily by import.io but with room for its friends & sponsors also- notably Lyft.

# Keynote (*sit)

Pitch for import.io, and some BS about insiration

# How Lyft grew by 5x (*walk)

Not bad. Interview format. Cool to hear about the simulator using read prod data for new algorithms and Line before it became live.

# Data science at Etsy (*step)

Cool walkthrough of how they recommend things, and why they do.

# WhoSay (*sit)

Crappy marketing pitch, no data

# Baidu (*walk)

I missed the first part because I was checking out the workshop upstairs briefly.

# DrizzyAI (*step)

The MC was also a presenter. He really likes a rapper and wrote a twitter bot about it.

# Only Data Scientist (*step)

Watched it. Eh.

# Data at Netflix (*hike)

Apparently this one was great, but I had to go to work.

# GoodData

Missed it; I was at work

# 100 best restaurants on Yelp

Apparently this one was good, but I had to go to work.

# Misfits (*sit)

Crappy long sales pitch

# Chegg: death of the Unpaid Internship (*hike)

Missed it, but friends said that it had sounded good.

# Kaggle (machine learning competitions)

Very cool. I need to do more research. I wish there had been more discussion of algorithms rather than platforms.

# Chief Algorithms Officer (of what?) (*step)

meh

# Teespring (*bike)

He's wearing a friar costume. :) [https://twitther.com/@allforjesse]

What good SEO means (cool graphs)
"pogo stick" clicking into a link in a google search, then backing up and clicking another one- this means that the first link was not good enough, and causes it to be ranked lower.
