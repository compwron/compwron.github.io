Why am I doing this? My tiny-company CEO thinks it would be nice to have a cool thing for each week's remote team happy hour, and I'm willing to do this. So Here goes. 

1. Cast the oculus to a chromecast screen, point the laptop at the chromecast screen
1. Install https://www.airserver.com/Download/MacPC on a mac, cast to the mac directly, share screen to zoom
1. Install https://immersedvr.com/ and try to use that to do the same
1. Install https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/features/mac-and-windows on a mac, cast to the mac directly, share screen to zoom
1. Follow official Oculus blogpost to use the `adp` tool to (over a cable) show screen info to the mac, then zoom share screen. Downside: the video might look funny- two eyes mirrored, weird distortion https://developer.oculus.com/blog/oculus-go-wired-mirroring-how-to/?locale=en_US
