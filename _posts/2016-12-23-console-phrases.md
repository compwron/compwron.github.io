I asked: Where a religious person would say "you'll be in my prayers" ... What is there to be said? "Sending good vibes"? Halp

Answers:
-
- You'll be in my thoughts
- You're in my heart
- I'll be thinking of you
- I say keeping you/them/whoever in my thoughts
- Sending you happy thoughts and well wishes.
- Fuck being in someone's thoughts. Send me baked goods and prove it.
- I'd pray for you, but unfortunately, we live in an unsupervised naturalistic universe in which there exists no deity to answer them. With no God above to do our work for us, all I can do is _think_ for youâ€”to use the time I would have spent appealing to God, to search my model of reality for non-divine interventions expected to steer the world into regions of state space that rank higher in (my model of) your preference ordering. It probably won't work.
- I'd suppose that's the best thought; but also, like the phrase "I'll be praying for you", best used sparingly. To quote my religious dad: "you know, people praying for us has been nice, but you know what's been really nice? The people lending a hand, or visiting the hospital, or helping out the family during this tough time."
- I often use "hope" and "wishing" instead. Not sure how well it's received but it seems like a similar sentiment of thinking of someone with positive vibes... Unfortunately, physical help can be difficult if you're several states away. :/
- I'm going to be the person not on the prayer hate bandwagon and say I'm actually really appreciative of people thinking positively of me.
While I don't believe in any deities, the idea that someone would take time out of their day to call upon an infinitely more powerful being to help little old me is pretty cool. Honestly, I wish people thought positive things about me more just in general.
- stare at them the way you stare into the cold emptiness of the universe...or you know say "i hope x"
- For close relationships, a small, concrete offer of help that you can truly provide: "Let me know if I can send you some food / take care of your dog for today / watch over the kids". Sometimes just something s simple as "Can I give you a hug?"
- One that I have used: "I'm sorry to hear you are unwell, I'm hoping that the day that you are healthy comes sooner than expected". People have told me it has been uplifting for them
- This isn't exactly what you asked for (and there are good suggestions for that above) but I share this any time I see a discussion of "what to say in any crisis" because it's just expert level #adulting.

- Say whatever you genuinely feel towards them in exactly the words that you are inclined to use.
- Yep. I send good vibes.
- Sending healing thoughts, positive wishes.
- I can empathize with you and can listen if you want.
