It is hard to pick a good thing.

- [Beam $49](http://www.beam.dental/brush) My favorite. Out of stock / canceled. Takes 1 AA battery
- [Kolibree $199](http://www.kolibree.com/en/) For kids, game app
- [Oral-B Black 7000 $200](http://oralb.com/en-us/products/7000-wireless-smartguide-plus-electric-toothbrush)
- [Grush $69](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/grush-the-gaming-toothbrush-for-kids#/story) and [website]() For kids, game app, Kickstarter
- [Rainbow $40](http://usvigilant.com/rainbow/) [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/VIGILANT-Rainbow-Smart-Toothbrush-Green/dp/B00M73CCDG)

What I want it to be:

- quiet
- rechargeable
- sends data to my phone

Why do I want an internet-of-things toothbrush? Because I feel like it helps me brush my teeth more often and reliably to get a little star / reminder on my phone. Also because part of me is a millennial and thinks it's cool.
