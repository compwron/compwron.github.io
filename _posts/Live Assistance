 Linda Goldstein: I would like to cancel my account. I don't need it anymore.

3) Business or role changed
4) Short term project completed
5) Financial reasons
6) Problems with faxing or billing

 Mike Berry: I completely understand your wish to discontinue. However, I can waive your subscription fee for 1 month so that you can re-evaluate your needs.

There is no contract and you may cancel anytime. Would you like to consider one month wavier period?
 Linda Goldstein: No thanks, just cancel it
 Mike Berry: I completely understand your wish to discontinue. Conversely, I can offer you a plan that will let you keep your eFax service for just 14 cents a day.

You make one annual payment of just $50 and pay nothing more unless you exceed 30 pages per month.
 Mike Berry: Extra pages are just 15 cents. This deal won't be available once your account is closed. Shall I switch you to this savings plan?
 Linda Goldstein: No thanks
