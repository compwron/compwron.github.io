A friend is very interested in working at my former company BT, partially because of the things that I have said about their awesome tech practices. I recommended him to the people there; I think that he would do well. We shall see where this goes.

I am in contact with the [Mission Techies](http://missiontechies.blogspot.com/) and I may be a mentor there soon!

I found out that both I and a coworker at BC have friends in the current session of App Academy :)

I attended the [#WomenAtSquare meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-square-2015-women-in-tech-tickets-17218776825): "Executive panel moderated by CEO/Founder Jack Dorsey, featuring Sarah Friar (CFO/Operations Lead), Francoise Brougher (Business Lead), and Alyssa Henry (Engineering Lead)."

* It was nice to see the awesome TWers. :)
* The intro was a little weird
* There was a lot of talk about family, partners
* The Q&A needed more moderation- very rambling multi-part questions

Fun quotes:

* "At insurance companies, in order to move ahead, you have to die or retire- I mean, someone else has to- ... I was getting in trouble for working too hard, mkaing my coworkers unconfortable. ..microsoft... I hear people sometimes sleep under their desks there- sign me up, that would be awesome..."
* "I was eyes on the prize! Get out of northern ireland..."
* "management consulting- was the easier path if you didn't know what you wanted"
* "my mom stil has not forgiven me, but that's ok"
* "I worked at goldman sachs ... please don't hate me"
* "you want to change things... 11 years, what took me so long?" "It was an interesting track, they kept stretching me"
* "Leadership is... how do you get people to know that it's ok, you dont need to ask permission for that, just move forward!"
* "all 3 of you are responsible for huge parts of the companies, and all of you have families"
* "Know what true north is"
* "Uber is fantastic! You don't have to drive your teenager everywhere!"
* "kids are emotionally fulfilling, but it was not 100 percent of me. I needed the intellecutal stimulation of going back to work."
* "How do you balance likability and respect in your work?" "I don't believe in likability in the workplace" WOOOO!
* "The tech bubble... bursted"
