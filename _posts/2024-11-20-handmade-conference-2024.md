"it is always morally correct to ask why"
"why do you program?" - to keep certain complex things alive. why. "some things go away that are good" "why?" "entropy" "something in the universe are good" 
"to make enough money to live comfortably" - programming - liked video games when teenager - why like video games? why. social bonding experience. 
"some software protects peopels wrights or gives hem the agency to respec tpeoples riht" "some ppl make software that doesnt respect pls rights" 
"because i lie uit" w "satisfying to solve prolems",

good practice for problem solving outside comuter... 
"fact impact question:"
"if ur going to work w other ppl, gotta comm with them"

communciation - same info on the other end o the pipe

possible to be too junior to know how to ask the question. think about what you know, what you're mssing,. what your objective is. if u just dont' know, titally lost, say so to someone. do that.
