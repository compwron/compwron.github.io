A Tech Lead Training Course
Overview
A training course for Tech Leads by Tech Leads. This course focuses on technical leadership skills for Tech Leads through discussion, theory and practical exercises opposed to general leadership skills for Tech Leads. We explore the unique combination of skills and experiences  that distinguish a “Tech Lead” from a “Leader working in a technical environment.”
Audience
A combination between a developer about to lead their first development team, or a Tech Lead for an existing team. This course will be most useful for those with the opportunity to apply their learnings immediately, or to experiences they can relate to.
Participants will learn:
What the breadth of the Tech Lead role encompasses
Why the Tech Lead role is necessary
What makes the Tech Lead unique from other leadership roles
What a Technical Vision is and how to shepherd a team towards a Technical Vision
What the common paradoxes a Tech Lead must manage
Why Cross Functional Requirements matter
How to identify and manage Cross Functional Requirements
How to manage path to production tasks and resources
How to manage technical risks
Why relationships matter and how a Tech Lead builds and maintains good relationships with technical and non-technical people
Different influencing styles
How to navigate conflict and find a way forward
Prerequisites
Participants will have had some experience working on a variety of teams, possibly tried facilitating several meetings and has had some experience with different parts of the software lifecycle (e.g. story writing, build and release infrastructure, development and test, release and/or iteration planning and production support)
What people have said:
“Information was very relevant and useful” - QCon Tutorial Attendee, San Francisco November 2015
“The course really helped me develop in my role as a Tech Lead” - Johannes Thoenes, EU4T June/July 2015  Attendee
“ I found you and your course both engaging and inspiring, and I would recommend any potential - or current - tech lead to grab the opportunity to attend if it becomes available to them.” - Gary Crawford, February 2015 Glasgow Attendee
“The day helped to make a few concepts clearer” - Johannes Thoenes, October 2014 Berlin Attendee
“It was great to attend the session and some of the tips shared are very helpful and I use it during my regular work” - Praveena Fernandes, October 2014 London Attendee
“The training together gave me a better understanding of the role.” - Luca Minudel, October 2014 London Attendee
“The positive for me was meeting and connecting with people [in a similar role].” - Jim Gumbley, April 2014 London Attendee
“Today was as awesome as expected!” - Caroline Cintra, Head of Learning and Development, Brazil (2013)
How it will be delivered:
The course runs over two full days using a combination of training techniques that includes presentation, discussion, video, interactive exercises and storytelling. It is assumed all participants will be co-located to maximise the discussion, storytelling and relationship building opportunities and learning experience.
Alternative formats are also possible in consultation including a shorter/less comprehensive 1-day session, or a half-day (over actual days) format.


Organisation requirements:
The course requires a training room complete with:
Moveable tables/chairs (ideally Cabaret/Banquet/Round-table style-seating to facilitate group discussion and group work) - See http://www.stagingconnections.com/events/choosing-the-best-seating-style-for-your-audience
Flip charts (with at least 30 pages - 3M sticky flipcharts preferred)
Flip chart markers (various colours - at least 2/3 new)
Space to hang flip charts around the wall + Blutack
Sticky notes - Yellow, Green and Pink (minimum of 2 fresh packs each)
2 boxes of Black & Blue Sharpies (24 pens)
If possible, 6 x different sets of markers (for the Tech Vision session)
30 pieces of A4 paper (for the Tech Vision session)
Projector + Screen or Large TV/Monitor
Logistics
Size - Ideally no more than 12 (just because there is group work)
Background - A mix of experiences is best to share lots of different stories (inexperienced + semi-experienced). Even those who have been a Tech Lead for a long time has been very useful for them because they rarely get to think and reflect on this
Project - People from the same/different project/company  doesn't make a really big difference between to the course - both brings different discussions but a mix is generally pretty good.a

concerns
Tech Lead == Architect?
I might have a wrong idea of a what a Tech Lead does
I might drink too much Mate (tea)
I might be too tired!
Work-life balance
Losing touch technically + socially
When not to fill out missing roles


Responsibilities

Look out for risks, Try to identify techncial risks, Thinking about technial risk, Understand our technical problems and challenges
Moderate architecture decisions
Understand the blockers and risks to the Dev Team
Figuring out, if there are only integration points with other teams
Identify (your own and team's) knowledge gaps and close them, try to learn the Tech Stack ASAP
Conflict resolution
On-site setup OK? (pairing station, etc)
Choosing the right tech, moderate Tech Stack decisions
Getting to know the team (skill, experience), get to know the dev team and understand their way of working, understand technical background of team members, being open for people's hopes and concerns, individual skills and strengths

'Team-decide' achieve agreement on the most basic stuff (libraries, design, code conventions, IDE)
Establish means of communicatino (wiki, mailing list, forum, commit comments), make sure the team knows what's going on
Estbalish feedback culture and exchange (code coffee talks, brown bags, code reviews) - helps to learn
Establish it's ok to fail culture, post mortems - helps to learn and improve
Onboarding
Be an advocate for the business (in front of developers)
Do what you like to do (once in a while)

Shaman

After the brainstorm (and a break), I then proceeded to present a few different Tech Lead models. Specifically:
Dan Abel's The Well-Rounded Technical Lead (A Model for Technical Leadership) | Engineering and Careering
The contents of the book Talking with Tech Leads by Patrick Kua [Leanpub PDF/iPad/Kindle];
and the contents of The Geek’s Guide to Leading Teams
Establishing a Tech Vision

We discussed the idea of a Tech Vision and using diagramming as a way of communicating an architectural Tech Vision. We briefly discussed Simon Brown's 4C model http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2014/08/24/c4_model_poster.html to introduce how to draw good diagrams.
Diagramming.JPGDiagramming2.JPG

We found that there were a few things that helped/hindered effective communication with diagrams.
HelpedHindered.JPG

Helped

Single level of abstraction
Explain why
Business context 1st
Talk about constraints (CFRs)
Start fresh
End architecture vision
Overall goal
Practice
Ask questions/invite questions
Conrete examples
Personalised
The 'right' level of detail
Not putting everything on one digram
Named diagram
Start with real/end users (use case walkthrough)
Multiple user journeys
Tech Stack/Libraries/Tools (later)
Patterns/Layers
New vs Old world architecture
Colour for different things
OVerlaying diagrams (different views)
Keywords
Hindered
Too abstract
Drawing small boxes
Too much jargon

Your Support Network

For lonely roles like the Tech Lead, PM, BA, it's important to realise that you are not alone.

Support.JPG
The support network you can rely on is:

The team
Sponsor
Former Tech Leads
Other people I know as Tech Leads
PM/CP
People team/Staffing TEam/RM
Partner
my.tw/SW Dev
Tech Council
Tech Lead Pairs
Tech Lead from close projects
Personal coaches
Retrospective

Keep Doing
RetroKeepDoing.JPG

Most of the content from us
Open format
Discussion involvement/rather than "top down"
Pointing to official resources for further learning, list of resources
Providing great resources as sharing points for further reading into the topic
Invite all stages/grades (grad, consultant, senior). Also other (Tech) Leads
The whole thing
Paradox discussion
Mixed group(from different teams)
Breaks
Very clear agenda
Practical Exercises
Great atmosphere/great explanations

Do Differently

RetroDoDifferently.JPG
Less talking from Pat - more discussions
Give time to prepare architecture diagrams

Try Next Time
RetroTryNextTime.JPG
How does the journey continue now?
What to do with the knowledge we now have?
Collect expectations before
More concrete examples on some models (e.g. situational leadership model)
Certified Thoughtworks Tech Lead ;-)
Some kind of roleplay
More pair exercises
More real life examples
People's personal goals
Maybe one or two 'difficult' subjects (like dev not performing/conflicts, etc) : Alternatively offer a fllow up workshop
Add sessionf or subjects that were brought up by the group
