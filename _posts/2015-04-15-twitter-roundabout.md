This is a pointless game. Instructions:

In a group in-person, write twitter handle on a paper, drop in bag. Draw a handle (other than yours). 

Rules: 

- pick a word with as many letters as there are participants. For each letter in this word, pick a word.
- first person tweets part of a thing that's in the room at the person whose handle they drew
- second person quotes the first tweet, adds the second thing, ats the next person (whose handle they drew)
- ...
- last person quotes previous tweet, at's the first person
- first person retweets the last tweet that was at-ted at them

Example:

@asd @zxc @qwe and @lkj are twitter accounts. They are people, sitting in the same room. We will pick the four-letter 'word' ohai (as in, "oh, hi!")

@asd draws @zxc

@zxc draws @qwe

@qwe draws @lkj

@lkj draws @asd

There is a thing on the board in the room. It says:

ocelot

happy

arduous

introspective

@asd tweets "ocelot @zxc"

@zxc quotes the tweet and says "happy @qwe"

@lkj quotes @zxc's tweet and says "arduous @asd"

@asd quotes @lkj's tween and says "introspective @asd ... OHAI!"

@zxc retweets @asd's most recent tweet

And the whole history should show up as a chain!

If one of the members skips their turn, the ending word is not a word.
