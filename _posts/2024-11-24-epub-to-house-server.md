how to put books onto the house server

1. install the mac kindle app
1. manually download the books
1. find the underlying download files
1. import them to calibre
1. install a janky decryption plugin I found on a forum somewhere
1. attempt to decrypt the pile of kindle files, it fails about half the time, 
1. delete the duplicates/failure, export the rest to epub
1. somehow put the epubs on the server
