Submitted a letter and poem to the mensa writers workshop [Calliope](http://www.calliopeontheweb.org/)

Got a typofix merged into the [rackspace developer experience job descriptions repo](https://github.com/jnoller/rackspace_devex_jobs/pull/2) and by the way I am a HUGE FAN of having job descriptions be able to have public pull requests

My favorite interesting repo right now is [rotten](https://github.com/rntz/rotten)

I've been continuing to slowly work on the [exercism](http://exercism.io/) exercises

I have an open pull request against [konacha](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/konacha/pull/200) because one of the teams at work mentioned that it was going to start using it. # it 

Mostly focussing my energy on the new job.
