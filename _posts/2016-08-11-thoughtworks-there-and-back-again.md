[The title is a Lord of the Rings (LotR) reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_and_Back_Again_(disambiguation))

This is the outline of a talk about working at TW, leaving TW, working at some other places, and working at TW again.

ThoughtWorks: there and back again

- why I left
   - project (not travel!), unsought really excellent opportunity
- why I came back
  - I missed y'all!
  - the startup I was working for was in the process of shutting down and my team was all openly talking about their interviews
  - I wanted to travel and teach TWU :)
  - I had several good offers and that made me feel free to choose what I want

- things I wasn't expecting:
  - having a boss (like a real boss, like in charge of me)
  - keeping in contact can feel weird

- things I learned:
  - not all companies will even try to pay you fairly
  - companies other than TW can be great at agile
  - really really good tech practices
  - team norming over *years*
  - empathy for client devs
    - being motivated to learn is structurally hard at a product company
    - talking to/joining other teams is structurally hard at a product  company
    - people leaving/joining teams normally Very Stressful
    - work event culture is structurally different
  - being on call and designing software for production
  - money faucet analogy
  - fancy offices/perks and why they made me feel weird

- awesome things about coming back to TW:
  - "Welcome back!" over and over and over :) :) :)
  - Found a few bugs / become a TechOps demo

- things that feel weird about TW to me now:
  - Some things change, some things stay the same (and you have no idea which are which)
  - Isolation, lateralism, hearing myself say "the way my OLD team did it"
