There was [a show and tell event recently at double union](http://doubleunion.tumblr.com/post/120787769184/show-tell-june-9th-6-30pm).

Presentations:

* [&:conf](https://www.andconf.io/) A code retreat that you need a code to get into. Literally in the woods. "code retreat and an unconference for intersectional feminist web developers" in August, 2 hr from SF
* [localwiki islavista](https://localwiki.org/islavista/)
* Yelp for costa rica biodiversity
* making art! glitter and broken glass. Clear sillicone
* [appapaloosa/prototapper](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jayne/appaloosa-mobile-app-prototyping-kit-for-curious-g/posts/1257925)
* Making shirts with diagrams of math on them by a methematics professor working at Tech Shop
* a song! by Mathilda about finishing dev bootcamp :) "This is the point of confusion just before you learn / This is the point of frustration before communicating for the first time" I really want to get this recorded.

Interesting notes:

* [Kaleidoscope](http://kaleidoscopecoffee.com/) a new cafe in Richmond! Coffee / ice cream / performance space (currently under construction, but hosting art this upcoming weekend at the [Point to Point Richmond](http://www.pt2ptrichmond.com) art walk)
  * permitting stuff is crazy! I want to hear more about this.
* Teaching math to undergrads gets old after a while

I'm considering applying to Double Union, and I thought that the answers to these questions would make an interesting post.

* Tell us a little about yourself!
  * I'm a developer without a CS degree. I enjoy reading science fiction, writing science fiction and code, and helping other people to understand things.

* Why are you interested in joining Double Union?
  * In order to talk to the peoples, use the awesome space to hang out in occasionally, and maybe run some workshops that I've been meaning to do, in a low-pressure space.

* Tell us about your feminism!
  * I've done some reading on the internet and I don't know what to think. Some studies find a pay gap in some situations, and other studies find it only in other situations. I once quit a college class for several reasons, one of which was that, because I was the only girl in it, I was not comfortable there. Once one of my coworkers went on about "looking like a Pantene commercial" with personal references and I don't know what to say to that. I present as straight but not femme, partially in order to be allowed to focus as much on code as my coworkers do. I enjoy attending Women Who Code events. I think that telling blonde jokes is an indicator of non-empathic thinking and a non-nuanced worldview, and also really annoying.

* What would you like to work on in the space?
  * Mostly writing code and writing science fiction. Possibly some soldering and sewing. I would try to run a writing workshop and maybe a lightning talks night every so often.

* What skills are you most interested in learning, improving, and/or teaching?
  * I like teaching beginners how to get started coding; learning at the very beginning is one of those things that are really hard because of all the things that you don't know that you don't know, and getting past that point is super important.
  * I would like to learn more about different art forms, how to organize conferences, and security practices in the wild.
