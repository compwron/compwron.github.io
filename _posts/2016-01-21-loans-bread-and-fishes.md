Questions/docs asked of me via email by a person who works for a bank, from their bank email, during the process for getting a "pre-approved loan" before attempting to buy a property containing a house:

- How much do you want to Purchase?
- How much do you want to put as a down payment?
- Bank statements with ALL pages to show assets and sufficient down payment.
- How much do you currently pay in Rent and how long have you been renting at this address?
- You may get an email to log into “yourLoanTracker”. Please do so within 24 hours, so you can remotely follow the loan process and any updates, etc.
- If you are Self Employed, we’ll also need any 1099's, Corporate 1120 Tax Returns & K-1 with all Schedules especially “C”.
- Pay checks covering the past 30 days
- How long have you been at Company X? (Dates)
- How long were you at Company Y? (need a 2 year employment history with approx. dates)
- Can you send the final paycheck for Dec 2015 which will have your total YTD income for 2015?
- Bank statements with ALL pages to show assets and sufficient down payment. If you want to purchase at $500k with 20% down payment, then you’ll need to show assets of over $100k. However, if your credit scores are above 740, you may put less, but that would be a different scenario.
- Will your parents be gifting you money for this purchase?
- FULL Federal Tax Returns for last 2 years (2013 & 2014) (Federal 1040, not State 540) and 2015 W-2 when you get it.
- Need your birthdate
