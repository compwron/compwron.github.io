Can words/sayings that today are problematic become ok in the future when the group who is affected by the word/saying achieves more equal status in society?
For example no one bats an eye when people in the USA pretend to be Italian and exaggerate their accent and hand movements. However saying "let's pow wow" isn't an appropriate way to have a meeting. If native Americans one day reach socioeconomic equality with the general population, would saying "let's pow wow" be interpreted no differently than saying someone needs to "come to Jesus" since you wouldn't be punching down anymore?
