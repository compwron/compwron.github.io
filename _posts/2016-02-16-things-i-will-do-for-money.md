What is this about?

"Happy Smiling price isn't supposed to be the amount that will cause you to enjoy the work itself. It's the amount that makes you happy enough to smile when you imagine accepting the deal."


## Disclaimers

I do not actually promise to do any of these, even if all my conditions are met. All of these would depend on scheduling and stuff. Some of these things I would be willing to do for free, occasionally and if I felt like it.

"Price variation, potentially including negative exists beyond one purchase of a service from me according to a formula unknown to me until such an event arises that varies by customer and circumstance. Customer satisfaction not guaranteed. Exploit *that*, you economically literate powergaming munchkins."

None of these are what I would consider market-competitive prices. Probably you should not pay them.
