200 days. Six months, ish. How is that job going?

569 commits, 254 "cards"

One senior-staff-leaves-and-everyone-worries

One (mild) reorg

One everything-is-great-and-we-will-be-rich

Several conferences on the company's dime

Some continuous integration frustration

A lot of being release manager / handyman / oncall

Lots of features (including Feature Feature, which deserves a blog post of its own)

My favorite parts:

- Putting code into production and having users use it and like it (well, mostly)
- Unlimited vacation and a healthy culture around using it (Conferences are great!)
- Tech talks! (They are not embedded in the culture yet, but we are starting)
- Making the Women@ group more active
