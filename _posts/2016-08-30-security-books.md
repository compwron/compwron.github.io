Hey guys! TWU 37 reunion thread!

They're not books but here are some other resources that I've been bookmarking and collecting thanks to the Security efforts that have been going on in Australia lately:

OSCP Certification (I'm told it's one of the few certifications that are really really worth doing)
https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/

OWASP Intentionally Insecure apps which are great for practice:
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Rails_Goat_Project

Secure Code Warrior
https://new-www.securecodewarrior.com/

Of those, Zalewski's book and "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook v2" are helpful if you want to get a grasp on what's at stake when developing web applications and understand how to start testing for flaws.

Paragon's awesome-appsec list has another few books and resources that are worth looking at. Some are not very relevant to what we do (for example, the book on IDA Pro)

O'Reilly recently published a book on DevOpsSec that is a quick read, but unfortunately I think it is only in ebook form.

A new book series I've seen mentioned a few times lately is Holistic Infosec for Web Developers. It is still being written. I haven't had a chance to go over it yet. It's available on GitHub here, here, and here if anyone is interested in taking a look. Let us know what you think if you do.



​I've been reading The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications [1]. Although the book is focused on web applications, it is totally worth the reader's time.

Anything from Michael Zalewski – author of the American Fuzzy Lop [2], among many other tools – is worth a look.

- Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier
- Foundations of Cryptography by Oded Goldreich
 - CyberWarfare by Jeffrey Carr
- Security Warrior by Cyrus Peikari

“Security Engineering” by Ros Anderson.

+1 to The Tangled Web; it's one of my favourite books. I've got Silence on the Wire in my to-read list, and I've found a copy of the Red Team Field Manual to be pretty invaluable in the past as a quick reference for more obscure CLI commands.



I'm a new XD ThoughtWorker -- hi! Before I got here, I was working on usability for open source encryption tools (including doing a little work for pixelated) at Simply Secure and the (now-defunct) Open Internet Tools Project.

Cade Cairns asked me to post a list of texts on usability and security. Here's the fundamental ones I know of:

Usable Security: History, Themes, and Challenges (Synthesis Lectures on Information Security, Privacy, and Trust)
by Simson Garfinkel

Beautiful Security: Leading Security Experts Explain How They Think
by John Viega and Andy Oram

Security and Usability: Designing Secure Systems that People Can Use
by Lorrie Faith Cranor and Simson Garfinkel

Lorrie Cranor is a leader in organizing the security usability field, and has co-authored a number of other books as well. (Plus she makes amazing digital quilts!)

So Tsatsi Sylivester Mahase, these may be security-related books you want to add to the Jo'burg library. And hey, Sara Dinari, I'd love it if we could get these in the NYC library as well!
