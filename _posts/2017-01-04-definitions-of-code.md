title: "Definitions of Code"

This is the type of pedantic nonsense that rarely if ever matters in the real world, and that's ok.

What is the definition of code?

This discussion happened to me most recently when prompted by a friend saying-


"what's your opinion on Ada Lovelace?  Do you think she really wrote the first computer program?"
To which I thought- O man, y'all. This could go deep.

My response:

I don't think about it much. That is the version of the story that I have heard. But when you get into definitions... I mean, someday "write code" will not involve typing on keyboards. Will it still be code, or writing? Maybe code is that which is executable and has a syntax tree, regardless of origins? Or maybe "code" is "letters stored via electronic media that can be executed and have a syntax tree" but I believe that there is "code" which is encoded not in electronic media
like, loom patterns and Magic the Gathering is technically Turing complete [1](http://www.toothycat.net/~hologram/Turing/HowItWorks.html) [2](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Magic-The-Gathering-Turing-complete) [3](http://www.metafilter.com/119840/Magic-the-Gathering-is-Turing-complete) so I regard certain stacks of MtG cards as "code". It gets complicated around the edges. Arguably, maybe what Ada made wasn't "code" as we know it because that didn't exist yet, never mind that the concept can be retroactively extrapolated to include those artifacts. Also it doesn't really matter to me, except as in incidental point in discussions about modern tech community and stuff, which does matter a lot to me, but did-Ada-write-the-the-first-computer-program is second-order matterment to me, at most.

Understandable.
Why do you ask?

Oh I just got into a discussion on reddit the other day about a woman who passed away recently -
the headline was something like ''woman scientist who proved the existence of dark matter passes away'' -
and everyone was like, whoa, hang on, dark matter is still very much hypothetical -
and that maybe the author of the article was just trying to score feminist points by saying this woman had *proven* dark matter -
here's the response that I responded to, and I brought up Ada Lovelace -
https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5kf5s9/scientist_who_discovered_dark_matter_vera_rubin/dbnlq90/
My understanding is that Babbage never actually *built* his analytical engine, that it was built much much later by others -
so it seems a little strange to me that we praise Lovelace for writing a ''program'' (in whatever format) for a platform that didn't even exist.
hm,
I consider it very accepted today to write code that cannot be compiled except by something that is build-in-progress
so that part doesn't seem odd to me

Interesting...
If we want to get into syntax&style analysis I would need to actually read the code in question
But the existence of code seems pretty clear
I mean, as I said before, one can debate what "code" is pretty much indefinitely
But I'm pretty comfortable with that portion of the grey area
What Ada did, I don't actually know without looking  it up
"writing a ''program'' (in whatever format) for a platform that didn't even exist." is pretty much business as usual for modern language devs

But such programs are developed in parallel with a target piece of hardware in mind, right?
Otherwise it's just...programming masturbation. ðŸ˜‰
Not necc. hardware
and not necc. in parallel
I mean, a lot of "programming" is the equivalent of sorting your socks
just for a lot more money and a longer-lasting sorted-socks-equivalent

Fantastic metaphor you've chosen!
stole it from the internet
it resonates with me tho

You enjoy programming and you enjoy sorting your socks, so...it works.
Now if you had said ''programming is a lot like slaughtering chickens,'' I'd be concerned.
