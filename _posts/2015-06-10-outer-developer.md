Once upon a time, there was [a python meetup at Yelp](http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/222835660/) (again). [Previous post](https://compwron.github.io/2015/03/24/attending-talks.html)

341 predicted attendees, and a line around the block at 6:15 (first entry time). There are a significant number of women- possibly as many as 15% by my terrible esitmates

Talks:

* Pitch by Yelp recruiter
* [takluyver](https://twitter.com/takluyver/) on sdist vs wheel, tool [flit](https://github.com/takluyver/flit)

* [coderanger](https://coderanger.net/) on how the internet works
* [glyph](https://twitter.com/glyph) on The Shadow Python!!!!! Dun dun dunnnn - [twistd](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted) + package ecosystem overview

Humans notes:

* Some dude wearing a hipchat shirt who has confirmed that he does not work for hipchat took a while to figure out how to stop telling me the names of chat clients. 
* There is a cool dude who works at [Appdynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/)
* Z's friend with the briefcase, hi!
* Cool lady to whom I talked while in line: you rock!
