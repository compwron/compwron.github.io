Goal: use the [Ace Makerspace](https://www.acemakerspace.org/ace_course/large-cnc-router-wood-training-and-certification/) [CNC (amt375)](https://wiki.acemakerspace.org/amt375/) to cut a bike rack for burning man, specifically the [tynkerstudios thingiverse SVG files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2669613?ref=ghost.tynkerstudios.com)

Status: ...not there yet

Notes:

Download [fusion360 for free](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal-form) instead of paying for [v-carve](https://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve-pro) I have - Fusion 2.0.18719 x86_64 [Native] Active Plan: Personal

[productdesignonline](https://productdesignonline.com/) is reportedly very useful but $399

"It seems like some of our problems are coming from paths not being contiguous in the SVG" - fixable with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

[Ace makerspace class slides PDF](https://compwron.github.io/files/ace-makerspace-CNC-router.pdf)


Does anyone have advice for the use of compression/up&down bits on this machine? My recollection from class is that they were a good intermediary between the benefits of up and down bit, but one of my collaborators saw them elsewhere (he thinks on an Ace resource though we can't recall which) described as "for production use, inappropriate here"


For big pieces I use down cut bits because upcut bits lift the middle of the wood up and my cuts end up deeper than theyâ€™re supposed to be. Since I can only clamp the edges.

Downcut bits also make for less tearout on the top

I dont really know compression bits so I have no advice there

I usually recommend  starting with 1/4in down cutters for most things on the cnc router

Compression bits are cool, and totally fine to use at ace, but usually more expensive than downcutters and just a touch more difficult to use vs downcutters, so I usually recommend using compression bits if you know you will need them. If you are not sure, it's hard to go wrong with a 1/4in down
