Notes:

Download fusion360 for free https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal-form instead of paying for https://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve-pro
I have - Fusion 2.0.18719 x86_64 [Native] Active Plan: Personal

https://productdesignonline.com/ is reportedly very useful but $399

"It seems like some of our problems are coming from paths not being contiguous in the SVG" - fixable with https://inkscape.org/"

Type of plywood research results: "i'm leaning for the [$91.20 ACX](https://www.ashbylumber.com/p/2332-x-4-x-8-acx-plywood-7-ply/34AC) or [$93.60 BB](https://www.ashbylumber.com/p/34-4-x-8-bboes-form-plywood-7-ply/34BB), i think slightly in favor of BB but the X might be worth C grade on one side?? idk. the cheap [$43.86 BCX](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handprint-23-32-in-x-4-ft-x-4-ft-BCX-Sanded-Plywood-Actual-0-703-in-x-47-75-in-x-47-75-in-211799/205723975) is probably Like Fine and would get us 2x the bike racks for the same price" see also https://forestplywood.com/blog/plywood/what-type-of-plywood-is-best-for-outdoor-use/ https://www.silvaris.com/the-different-grades-of-plywood/ https://www.h2ouse.org/bcx-plywood/
