I have always been pretty open about my salary face-to-face. I do believe that open salary data is an effective way to combat salary discrimination. Recently I learned that some people I know are getting salaries that seem to me disproportionate to where others at their same company and in their same role are at.

One hesitation that I have about publishing this is some significant personal embarrassment. I have never done well at salary negotiations and I know it. I deeply resent the practice of paying some people more because of salary negotiation skills.

Another hesitation and embarrassment I have in posting this is that I make a ridiculous amount of money by the standards of everyone except software developers in SF/NY- by which standard I am either underpaid or low-value, depending on what kind of pessimism I'm using. I do donate a good bit of my salary with an eye to the advice from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/), and I've also used a lot of it for stuff for my family. My rent (not counting utilities) has been about 1300/month since I've been in SF, which is a good price for the area. (Living in one room of a multi-room house brings the cost down quite a lot.)

* 2010 Chicago - ThoughtWorks - 55,000 plus healthcare and 401k matching (and expensing travel, train pass, and mobile phone) (How sure am I? Original document)
* Some missing history here with TW- I lost some docs, and although I could figure it out from tax records, the fact that I expensed a lot of travel for work makes the math more difficult.)
* 2014 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks - 97,000 (after cost of living adjustment for moving to SF) (How sure am I? Strong memory, no document)
* 2014 San Francisco - Braintree - 106,000 plus 10k signing, healthcare, 401k (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2015 San Francisco - Groupon (Breadcrumb) - 125,000 + RSUs (the value of RSUs changed a lot; eventually I sold them in 2017 for an approximate value of 5k), no 401k matching (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - Carbon Five (offer) - 135,000 (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - One Medical (offer) - 142,000 + RSUs (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks (offer - accepted) - 135,000 (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2017 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks - 144,500 (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2017 San Francisco - Grand Rounds (offer) - 155,000 + 10k signing + RSUs (non public company)
* 2018 San Francisco - Square (offer - accepted) - a little more base salary, plus RSUs (public company), no signing bonus.

My original "negotiation" with ThoughtWorks I remember vividly- it was in person, standing in the hallway with Julie (who is awesome <3) and I literally said "Well, I make minimum wage now, so... more than that?" ... not the brightest moment in negotiation history

Shoutout to TW for giving me a pretty fair salary given my lack of a CS degree, and with living cheap I managed to pay off my student debts in only 3 years or so of living in a $375/month apartment in Bricktown (helped a lot by the fact that a lot of my college time was paid for by various scholarships)

Note: it is legal to discuss salary (and illegal to fire people for discussing their salaries) in the USA [https://www.govdocs.com/can-employees-discuss-pay-salaries/](https://www.govdocs.com/can-employees-discuss-pay-salaries/) see also [ca.gov](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/California_Equal_Pay_Act.htm)

It is also interesting to look at salaries paid to USA federal employees, which are all public: [https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/](https://www.fedsdatacenter.com/federal-pay-rates/) and a non-governmental data visualizer/searcher: [https://www.federalpay.org/employees/agencies](https://www.federalpay.org/employees/agencies)

The twitter hashtag you want to see for (mostly tech) salaries is [#talkPay](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TalkPay?src=hash) And there is even a bot so you can see many of them in one place and/or submit your own info anonymously: [https://twitter.com/talkpay_anon](https://twitter.com/talkpay_anon)
