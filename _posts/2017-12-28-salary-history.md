I have always been pretty open about my salary face-to-face. I do believe that open salary data is an effective way to combat salary discrimination. Recently I learned that some people I know are getting salaries that seem to me disproportionate to where others at their same company and in their same role are at.

One hesitation that I have about publishing this is some significant personal embarrassment. I have never done well at salary negotiations and I know it. I deeply resent the practice of paying some people more because of negotiation skills (when negotiation skills are not part of the skills of the job.)

Another embarrassment and hesitation I have in posting this is that I make a ridiculous amount of money. I do donate a good bit of it, and I've used a lot of it for stuff for my family. My rent (not counting utilities) has been about 1300/month since I've been in SF, which is a good price for the area. (Living in one room of a multi-room house brings the cost down quite a lot.)

* 2010 Chicago - ThoughtWorks 55,000 plus healthcare and 401k matching (and expensing travel, train pass, and mobile phone) (How sure am I? Original document)
* Some missing history here with TW- I lost some docs, and although I could figure it out from tax records, the fact that I expensed a lot of travel for work makes the math more difficult.)
* 2014 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks 97,000 (after cost of living adjustment for moving to SF) (How sure am I? Strong memory, no document)
* 2014 San Francisco - Braintree 106,000 plus 10k signing, healthcare, 401k (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2015 San Francisco - Groupon (Breadcrumb) 125,000 + RSUs (the value of RSUs changed a lot; eventually I sold them in 2017 for an approximate value of 5k), no 401k matching (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - Carbon Five (offer) 135,000 (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - One Medical (offer) 142,000 + RSUs (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2016 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks (rejoin) 135,000 (How sure am I? Original document)
* 2017 San Francisco - ThoughtWorks 144,500
* 2017 San Francisco - Grand Rounds (offer) 155,000 + 10k signing and RSUs
* 2018 San Francisco - San Francisco Square - I won't put this here yet, but base salary was slightly higher than what I had, plus enough RSUs to be nice if I don't mess up handling them.

My original "negotiation" with ThoughtWorks I remember vividly- it was in person, standing in the hallway with Julie (who is awesome <3) and I literally said "Well, I make minimum wage now, so... more than that?" ... not the brightest moment in negotiation history

Shoutout to TW for giving me a pretty fair salary given my lack of a CS degree, and with living cheap I managed to pay off my student debts in only 3 years or so of living in a $375/month apartment in Bricktown (helped a lot by the fact that a lot of my college time was paid for by various scholarships)

Feel free to ask me anything at https://twitter.com/compiledwrong although of course I may not answer. :)
