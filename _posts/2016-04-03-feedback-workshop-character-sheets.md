These personas are for use at a feedback workshop where everyone gets a fake character sheet and has to have a conversation with other characters. This, I hope, lets the participants practice the skill of feedback as a pure skill without the concern of real-world repurcussions during the practicing process.

The workshop is "360" style, where everyone spends 5-10 minutes talking to each other person.

You can use these rounds, or have three participants draw a name from a hat each round.

Participants should have paper and pen with them during the feedback rounds to take notes.

Round 1:
Casey-Pete
Vivek-Sarah
Julie-Arkya

Round 2:
Casey-Sarah
Vivek-Arkya
Julie-Pete

Round 3:
Casey-Arkya
Vivek-Pete
Julie-Sarah

Round 4:
...




This session should always end with a 5-minute retrospective, where all participants write on sticky notes labeled smiley face, sad face, or question mark. The organizer should quickly group and read these stickies aloud, then incorporate them into the next version of the workshop.
