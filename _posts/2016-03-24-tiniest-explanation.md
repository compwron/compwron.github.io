I am looking for a job in the SF bay area, because Breadcrumb (merchant point of sale) which has been owned by Groupon for a few years, is no longer adding new customers. Almost all non-engineers were let go with no warning on the morning of 7 March 2016. This was very unexpected.

The development team is being kept on in order to maintain the app for all of the existing merchants. We are also adding admin features and auto-healing features that make it easier to do without the rest of the team and reduce pages down to near zero.

I expect that eventually most of the Breadcrumb developers will join other teams within Groupon or find other jobs.I am willing to join another team within the mothership as soon as I can get anyone to tell me what that would entail or how to go about it. In the meantime I've been doing some interviews with various companies. Yours could be one of them!
