[Glassbox](https://www.glassbox.com/) is a competitor to [Logrocket](https://logrocket.com/) and similar platforms. 
Glassbox is willing to sign a HIPAA BAA. 
Integrating with Glassbox can be slow- first we signed up on their website to get a demo. 

1. Demo happened, looked good. 
1. BAA / compliance discovery process. 
1. Then our point of contact introduced us to some other people. (All this via email threads)  

```
I'd like to introduce the team members from Glassbox who would be leading this initiative - 
<name1> - Professional Services Engineer: Technical liaison helping with integration. 
<name2> - Business Insights Manager : The analytics expert who will help you with deriving value out of Glassbox. 
<name2 (original contact)> - For escalations 
We have submitted the request to build the environment and the standard SLA is 48 hours. 

As soon as the environment comes up, <name1> will reach out to your team to schedule a call for kick-off/integration. 

For the development team, they will need access to our knowledge article for integration instructions. Please request via this link - Request Access
```

[Api docs request access link](https://www.glassbox.com/knowledge-center-registration/)

All this for an integration that I sincerely hope will be 1-5 lines of code

I do like that they spin up a separate environment for us- that's probably part of how they manage their BAA risk. 
I wish it were faster.
