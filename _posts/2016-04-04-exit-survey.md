I am under the general impression that there are major internal coordination problems between various [company] teams, services, initiatives, etc. I'm not sure, because I have very little visibility into any of them. I am unimpressed with the general level of internal learning  / training although my team was really good because we had awesome teammates and managers. :)

A major internal security audit might be a good idea.
