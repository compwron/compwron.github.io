title: "Hop with the Admiral: GHC15"
tags:
 - conf
---

The title of this post is an oblique way of describing the "Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing" conference. Grace Hopper was an admiral. "Hop" is the first part of her last name, and also the name of the volunteers that get free tickets. I am volunteering for some things, but my free ticket came from a different source (my current indirect-employer, Groupon, about which I know relatively little)

Unlike many previous years, I am not focusing on going to talks at GHC15, although I do consider the variety of this talks this year very good and a must-go. Instead I will be making connections, mentoring, sitting at various tables for various groups, talking to people, and going to talks when I find time.

## My goals (ordered list):

1. Meet and connect with the 5 IIT students that I am helping sponsor to be here. (Update: I give myself a B-)
2. Fulfill my promises with regards to mentoring slots. Mentor well. (Update: I give myself a D)
- lunchtime table talks total failure; no one could find it and no one came.
- Mentoring tables were cool but I was not useful
3. Show up on time for my table slots. Don't be absurdly terrible at whatever it is that people who sit at tables do. (Update: I give myself an F)
4. Meet and connect with as many as possible of the 70 people coming here from my current parent-company, Groupon (Update: I give myself a C-)
5. Greet and reconnect with awesome ThoughtWorkers (Update: I give myself an A-)
6. Greet and reconnect with the many people I already know who will be at the conference, especially those I met at previous conferences (Update: I give myself a B)
7. Attend and mingle at the various LGBTQ events (Update: I give myself a B-)
X. Attend awesome talks (Update: I give myself a B-)
X+1. Swag and meeting awesome new people and hearing their stories! (Update: I give myself a B+)

## Fears

Fears? More like certainties. It will be impossible to do all the things I want to do; I will not do perfectly at the things that I have promised to do. I will be tired, and probably cranky, and want lots of things that are impractical to have or pursue. But I think I will still be better off than if I had not come.

## Talks

Ezgi, who works at PROS, talking about Big Data (*sit)
Bloomberg - portfolio managements

12:45 session

Long lunch w/ Pl
Suprised in hallway. I am a doofus, why do

Not a huge fan of the app, the venue, the staff, especially not the badge readers...


talks attended: 2:15 wednesday, how to avoid bad things happening to you at work, then internet of things, with space satellites


value gained per head per talk. unmeasurable, but totally a thing.

people a, b, c in talk X
a gets 3 qualia ( new-to-them knowledge retained, in whatever format- paper, tweets, brain-only)
b gets 300 qualia
c gets 12 qualia
Average: 171.x, total 315

talk y had 50 ibservers who had an average of 15 qualia each. Total qualia is 750.
Average: 15, total: 750.

The goal is to keep both average and total high. x

Total goddamn nonsense on teh Distributed Computing slide

To me, GHC is the problem. It is deeply non-technical. The OSS track is registration-only. Too much towards total qualia vs average qualia- just add more people!

Notes for next time: DO wear GHC tshirt while commuting. DO dye hair first (?) DO prioritize people above talks. DO submit the maximum number of talk proposals. DO be working for TW but not the booth.

BuzzFeed talk was probably good.
Talk about challenges of offline mode / Breadcrumb?

Same. It's a lot easier on the speaker. Like pair programming for the stage

"And every day I wrote down three things that I did well. Some days it was hard. 'Made tea.'"
And three things I messed up.

Most useful swag. Socks? Chargers. Cords and batteries. Stickers? Headphones?

Some people want to be happy. I am not impressed by happiness. How about let's build good things, take care of our peoples, and be frustrated and confused and terrified and grumpy and all my favorite emotions that are not happiness.

It frustrates me that it is hard to know what the things that you could take advantage of.
Encouraging the crowd to yell louder and telling them that you are judging them on it

When it is grad school time, go to a conf and meet all of them.

Ideal GHC experience? Speaker on first day, mentor on afternoon of first day.

## People

- Met up with an old college friend (Katy) who happens to live in Houston after the last plenary and before the party :)
- Met coworker BMcA in person
- Hung out with coworkers MS and HC; met some other coworkers for the first time
-

## Surroundings

- Houston seems pretty cool; I would definitely visit again and go to museums, restaurants etc.

## Takeaways

- There were surprisingly few people who felt like "my clan". This seems odd to me. I might be doing it wrong.
