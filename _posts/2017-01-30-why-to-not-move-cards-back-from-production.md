Team morale

Confuses the product owner (seeing the same card demo'ed twice, or something that they have "approved" being "unapproved" - this is supersceding the product owner's ownership of the product, and that can make everything more confusing, and sometimes step on the toes of the product owner)

It's harder to track what work is where- cards that go backwards are a little unusual- they are more unusual, the further they go backwards... sometimes a card will get through dev and then need to be reverted and re-analyzed. This is a waste of effort but if you are in that situation, it's better to do it than to not do it.

Once it's in prod, you're not taking the code out- the "map" (the story wall) should match the "territory" (where the code is), as far as is possible/useful.
