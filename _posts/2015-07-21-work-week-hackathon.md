5 days (not including the long Monday morning meeting and the all-day-Friday Presentations) of building stuff! Wooo!

* I have built some weird things of my own devising, learned a lot, made some PRs against codebases I don't usually work in. I am enjoying it. Other people appear to be doing good things also.
* Possibly my most useful contribution so far has been to make a long list of all the hackathon ideas that I have had and send it to everyone. This is the hard part for some people who are not me.

Themes beyond hackathon:

* The women's restroom has been broken a LOT lately. The secondary restroom is a ways away.
* There are two sub-teams working in the same codebase and we do not always agree with each other
* slow/flaky cucumber tests
* Some people participate in team retros; some do not.
* I'm still trying to post in the "Women at Company" chatroom weekly or so to keep it alive, and I frequently get a response or two
* Spent my first week on call for this team. It was properly uneventful except for the after-effects of a network outage
* long PRs
* approaching a more healthy level of ongoing tech debt cleanup
* starting big initiatives
* helping the QA team figure out how to test weird things
