This year I'm a team lead for [Ruby4Good](https://rubyforgood.org/) on the CASA project which is actually for [Prince George's County CASA](https://pgcasa.org/) which is one chapter of the national org. We're hoping that we will someday grow to be multi-tenant application and that has been much on my mind as we build towards usability for our single tenant. 


What have I gotten out of r4g? 
Meeting some cool people
Pairing
More rails in my life, with modern rails!
