THese are my notes (in reverse order, most recent up top) from LWT summit, which was in the Castro Theater.

## Impressions and Feelings

At several points during the day, I felt overhelmed with the amazingness of beign surrounded by these people. Giddy. Having a friend with me was helpful.


## podcast "call your girlfriend"

- "is there any company that is doing it right, doing anything?"
- "He said- the men and women of Company"- and they were all men.
- "They're very sensitive men here in Silicon Valley"
- "Twitter (leadership) has three Peters and a Dick"
- "Let's none of us never touch rupert murdoch"
- "Can you help me find women?" (he said) "They mean well- they just sit around and mean well and they don't do anything about it."
- "If you look around the boardroom at twitter and you don't notice that there are ten white guys, you're a fucking idiot" (I disagree- it is hard to find the unusual in surroundings that look like you, when you're used to it.)
- She mentioned running for mayor of SF someday
- She would make a citywide day where you just wear polka dots
- "my great grandfather was- I wont say mafia, but- nearby"
- "I work harder, I make more calls. journalist- persistent, curious"
- CIA, gay, outness (they wouldn't take her because she was gay, but she was out, so what's the problem?)
- She identifies as patriotic
- She joined the military in order to pay for medical school. She hated Don't Ask Don't Tell
- "which is probably a good thing- I shouldn't have a gun"
- "I really hate format fetishists" (re: paper books vs ebooks)
- She reminisced about the big phones in the newsroom
- She reminisced about her fellowship at Duke university
- "How brave can you be in the workplace?"
- "What should I do?" "what do you want to do?"
- "Now that I have sons, I understand the arrogance of men. They think the world is their oyster. I've tried really hard to make them insecure, but..." (audience laughs)
- "always ask for tons of money!" (when the speaker was negotiating with someone who happened to be a friend) "Come onnn, we're friends...." "I super love you but give me the fucking money"
- she is on twitter!
- "when you start on third base, you tend to make it to home base pretty quickly" (on privilege)
- There are both Clinton and Bernie supporters "and I respect it"
- caremad
- "This one is a fear election, not a hope election" :(
- Question: what do you (regret not doing?) My answer: not working for spacex, nasa (yet!)


## ignite talks

### [teaching comics to refugees](@AliFitzterrible)

- volunteer teaching comics at refugee shelter in germany
- Visual Storytelling as a Tool for Social Change (i.e. Syrian Refugees) in the Age of the Meme
- timing issues with slides
- brain parsing as scene rather than as lines
- kara swisher, re/code empire.

### "css vs my gender"

### fear

- we become our stories, and yet they are just stories.
- names of trans ladies, ginger, phoenix
- prefer concrete examples
- sooo much of human psych is that what you believe about yourself becomes true.


### kinsey scale for diversity

- diversity points
- kinsey scale- totally outdated
- white, cisgender, hetero, able-bodied is all the one end of this theoretical scale


## "fucking risk"

- She spent her late brother's life insurance money on a startup that failed and she doesn't regret it.
- start small! She started LWT with an fb event page
- basic premises- no one can lose their job because of sex/gender
- "If the world were (more like us) it would be better" this is an extremely common / universal sentiment... is a logical fallacy? Or an appeal-to-audience? Or is there another name for it?
- The conference has lots of self published mini videos that are well done. I like it more for short introductions than attempted standup comedy / MCing, at least.
- The speaker was intro-d while carrying a child. Presenting while carrying a child might be an entertaining speech but it would require a backup plan...
- "buzzfeed is disturbingly reputable nowadays"


## SpaceX

- The speaker has a BS aerospace engineering, 9 years ago
- Her nickname is "mother of dragons!" which is a Game of Thrones reference and also a reference to the SpaceX Dragon capsule
- 22 successful launches to date

- ibm chef watson.com
- inaccurate usage of "decrypt"

## How to Leverage Your Most Compelling Advantages

- It started out as total bs "do what you do well" with no other content
- Global Product Manager, Citigroup, Lisa Davis
- "I look fascinating to everyone. I could back up and try to hide in the wall paper, but I use it to my advantage. They will REMEMBER me. You gonna talk about me. That is my advantage and I will damn sure use it."


## break

I visited the TW booth. Square has the best tshirts :)

We visited Hot Cookie. Mmmm, cookies.


## White house tech innovation summit

- tweets- #transneeds
- In order to spread it, they negotiated with celebrities to tweet about it

## genentech

## Ramona, Decalara

- Future of educational tech
- When she says, "for- well I won't tell you how long-" is that ageism? Implying that long-ness is embarassing and not to be admitted to?

(audience applauds)
