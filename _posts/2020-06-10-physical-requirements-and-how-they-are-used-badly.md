Some job descriptions for software developers and other sit-and-think jobs include phrases about physical requirements (see examples below)

This is an (attempted) legal hack to scare off people who need [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) accommodations. If someone takes the job and then requests ADA accommodations, the company hopes that they can say "but it's required in the job description, we don't need to accomodate you" which... is unlikely to work. But if the company scares people off in the first place, they don't need to pay for losing an ADA court battle. 
See [the Ninth Circuit decision](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/employer-s-after-fact-discovery-lack-job-qualification-sinks-employee-s-ada) which says that exclusionary job prerequisites are invalid. 
As a discriminated-against potential employee, the legal counter-move is to argue that reasonable accommodations are possible, like having a standing desk rather than sitting for 6 hours. But also if a comany does this for a reason other than "our lawyers gave us some boilerplate" they are assholes and you probably don't want to work there anyway if you have better options.

### Why do these phrases show up in job ads?

These precise legal phrases are in job ads as a way to try to make it legally defensible to decline to hire people because of their physical disabilities, but that is actually illegal. But if the job description scares off the people who would request ADA accommodations from applying, then the company is "winning" anyway. Fuck them.
