Scrutinizing the Scrutiny  - Jason Hand


pitch from post email company

Speaker 6: Jason Hand, victorops
I wish someone had said "wht "is" uptime
he looks diffferent from his twitter bio
oreilly post-incident reviews
mi - purposefully doxing between talks
mi todo- harvest post-incident revies? Post software dev postmortems? radar recommendations?
prezi :)
"there is never a root cause" always a combination of factors
systems constantly in states of partial failover  degrdation
field guide to understanding human error - book, recommended
people cannot be the root cause we have to build systems around how people work, # (mi) not want people to work like the system says"
https://smile.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Understanding-Human-Error-ebook/dp/B00BL0OZ0E/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=
https://victorops.com/oreilly-post-incident-review/
wins best slides
mi - acid throat?
timeline an "account of" what happened- promote openness and descriptiveness
very nice graphics
prezi and narrative
are amazon book IDs the same fo different people? https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B00BL0OZ0E
really nice in-detail from VictorOps
https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00AZRBLHO
https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/
this is the first talk that I would recommend that my teammates maybe watch- mostly Saleem
"how do we avoid those shoulder-tapping executives?"
SNC- do we have a status page? must be PUBLIC - todo recommend paid(?) options? for each API
sr vs jr grr, cathy jr grr
"dinner with their wives" I hear that as a micro-sexism ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ not enough to call out (most days) but enough to feel it hit as it goes by.
state of devops report 2016 - read and myTW post
our cost of downtime - average purchase amount per minute: mbff vs order-api and dependenvies, vs store stuff
SNC- we need to work more closely w Brett
"it was someone in support, not EVEN someone in engingeering who could DO something about it" ugh dude
what should and should not page? - todo "when everybody is on call, nobody is on call"
universal/interactive runbook
https://runbook.io/
basic checklist- responders have access? notice issues via customer support, clear escalation path- ask each human- "what do you do if?" for a scenatior- a friend pings you, you see a tweet... you see a weird spliunk graph
Downtime in exchange for innnovation
"When everybody's on call, nobody's on call." @jasonhand #uptimeconf

"the Ms all turn into Bs" (meg to billion?)
I am looking at the source code that they lost, rightnow- I can feel it. it's warm to the touch
firmware
"The firmware is not going to page you. I could- or I could just not do this [the firmware says]"
Raft preferred over zookeeper
ZFS
mis-changed polatiry of the head jtags on spindle. prevent actually destpring drive. 550 ms outlier. time for drive to reboot. (OMG)

latency outliers
"when i concieved of this talk, I had a conga line of broken firmware"
DRAM DIMM correctable vs uncorrectable- sent to firmware. Firmware First

trump jokes
"there were not mistakes on both sides"

we need OSS firmware- that's the post-singularity rapture

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_router_firmware_projects
"I wouldn't get any laptp that Netflix can't stream on" (as reasoning to not get a linux laptop)
I enjoy listenign tot the gentle chatter of geeks- alfred, flash, firmware...

"I derailed up to 77 businesses that day"
threatstack
some very company-pitch-sish talks

TODO me read src of rabbitmq?
TODO write work consulting workshop "I don't want to shit on the work of these people, it just did not work, for us , at that time, with our existing infrastrucutre"
"sometimes it is just goodo to know with what you know (esp when youre in a hurry)"
"kafka was way too new in 2014 for us to depend our entire livlihood and stack on it"
TODO list of things to proof-f-concept because it's importnt to be ablto to chose the right tool without having to choose the tool that you know best- know enought hat you can choose the right answer!
rabbitmq does not do network partitiions well
"a series of servers surrounded by network partitions"
twitter handle from every presenter- some of them on every slide
3 yr - solid longevity
how do you make RMQ highly available? by not clustering it!
"data on the queue longer than milliseconds is an alertable condition for us"
Rack Aware (AZ) writes - if one AWS ec2 szone goes away....
this talk is teching me things, yay
kafka- lets you re-play transactions
time series daya is so cool
buy, then build? don't build it if you ..
if you don't have the time, there are ways to buy your way out of this"
"very large infra across multiple public clouds"
how good you are now vs how much I can learn from you talking about what you have done before- related but not the same (mi)
collectd- one of many similar tools
people sitting on the floor in the balcony, looks like good places tho
money vs time
libratto
collectd -> write_http -> (logo) blue square w two rounded corners, a hole in the middle, a dot the size of the hole right after the square
collectd -> write_graphite -> graphite
"write it into collectd" ? can run to instances of collectd
opens ource https://prezi.com/developers/open-source-thanks/
hw-cookbooks (chef cookbook)

get devs to own applciations
"want your devs to ops? build consumable services"
"You want to know if your seb server is running netcat or mining bitcoin!"
auditd logfile format - he dislikes itnot all lines in keyvalue format, events can help multiple lines
events can be out of order
he doesn't like any current OSS security sofware (whaaat)
slackhq/go-audit you still have to consume the events...
ossec.github.io
http://strut.io/
osquery.io - from facebook, kinda like sql queries (no change over time)
dralos/falco - requires kernel modules
"I'm kinda showing my neckbeard... I don't like kernel modules, I've been burned by them, not allowed in my environments"
if the attacker can see the alerting rules on the host, they can get around them
SIEM, SIM, SEM - terms meansing sec event management
SEM- real time analysis, take immediate action
SIM- long term trending, make auditors happy
they do dogfood
wooden picture of Inception
put watches on keyfiles, get notified if it changes
catch poor operational practices to catch issues before breach
put visibility into chat- devs can claim the event (can even add a slackbot to notice claim and esclate in not) slack- "is this you?" if not.. then.... :)
DuoAuthentication
"if you see a db dump on a server (whcih should not be there) do you know who to go to?" - great concrete example
aalyze VPN connection logs (texas vs taiwan for a user)
"if you capture the data, you can do cool things with it later"
"trying to catch your engineers..." O.o
"safe access to production"
"understand why humans have to log into servers, and automate it away"
threatstack/ts-ldap
threatstack/authkeys
github.com/threatstack/deputize integrates with ldap, pagerduty - when you go on call, your ldap group changes and you get the right access WOW
bastion host, etc
there is a big checklist buried in here somewhere - includes bastion, logging netcat, alterts, dynamic permissions
no jet lag prblmes, just lack of sleep prpblems

I mentioned to him- their recruiters failed pretty hard- a list of hard questions for recruiters

jj and hotel for lunch? Find chetlin?
@devopshaikus
Petnet pet feeder outage
Workshop: think of ways this company can fail (make some example company profiles- finance, pet feeder, hamburger-sale) if you don't know a thing (like ... then make it up, state your assumption, and keep going. If the question is "how does this work, I need to know so I can answer the question- for now the answer is "choose what would make sense, and keep going)
"emergent behavior that we couldn't reason about when desining the system"
I say- thougthworks and people are like "yeah!!! great almni!"

Human chaos monkey- give me your laptop, take a four day weekend whaaat
hardware chaos monkey. give windows, go work incident.
deal with oncall on a different laptop, see if it works / practice it aaaaaa
Analogy with fire trucks- they take away the truck and gear, refill truck, coil hoses- time to get ready for next incindet (they CAN go direct to next fire, but it's better to have everything back in place...)
jpaureed.com/blame-aware-postmortems

netflix can opt out of chaos money for 4 or 6 months...
plane analogies
outcome bias
nice video playing working and audio
"that was a horrible deployment but no one wants to hear about it because hey it got deployed"
"counterfactual languge" is "why didn't you notice x/ do z" caounterfactual language- it didn't happen, and we are talking about it.. (learn more??)
rhyme-as-reason effect, if it rhymes you will like/belive it more
te audio experiemnt- can understand the distorted version after hearing the real
"we have 8 million action items from one incident" sloppy incedent response -
"main engineer who worked the incident, she's on vacation"
delaying retros makes it less godd.
Rasmussen triangle, "exploring the discretionary space"
"incidents, not accidents"
saying the basics over and over, because it's hard to internalize this stuff, and some people don't know, and it's important to know.
Amazon- blameless description, learned a lot- did not just stop at "human error"
"Your incident immune system" gets better the more you use it
my notes are about to get a lot crappier if I run out of power
