Cafe week, day 1. 

Pushed a commit with the user.name set to my old company, oops. Fixed it and force pushed a few hours later. 

Solved the "space age" exercism.io problem. Re-solved it using metaprogramming, which I am actually a bit proud of. Did not manage to submit it to the site itself because of some unknown local problem which appears to have been opened and closed as a bug in 2014. 

Added some things to the 'cafe week' trello board.

Approximate working hours: 10am - 3pm at cafes and home.

Did other useful life things not related to code.
