It is only month four? We are definitely well into the steady state of forever (phase 1) i.e. time to look beyond Getting Things Done to Improving How We Get Things Done.

Numbers:

* 317 commits in ~4 months. Again, git flow and squash make these numbers basically unintelligibly weird, and I don't have my gem pairSee in a state that can parse our git history sensibly yet.
* This is actually 112 days after I started, so ~3.7 months.

Thoughts:

* Going to a conference is quite a hassle if you expense it, book flights through the company travel system, etc. In the future I will strongly prefer local conferences. Not much of a hardship since this is SF, but annoying.
* I am excited to go to &conf! I am not expensing this because then I would have to explain "intersectional feminism code retreat" to several people, and it's pretty cheap for a conference.
* One on ones are still A+ awesome at venting, fixing problems before they are big, and checking in.
* Not all things that are called "pairing" are similar to what I think of as "pairing" and sometimes it bothers me. I do miss pairing, even though it is much easier to not.
* IceCube is an interesting ruby library that I am now extremely familliar with but not super fond of.
* BC townhall went well. Getting a seat is nice. Pre-recorded video animations are strange to me. The Big News has not been told to us yet.
* CrumbBake technical talks are an EXCELLENT way to improve many of the things that I care about at an office (internal learning, developer communication)
* Two of my favorite people are leaving. :/
* There are a lot of distractions in the team room. Open plan is not terrible, but I prefer open team room separate from other areas.
* Lots of figuring out what we should have built after actually building it; this seems to happen more to me than to others right now. This is the thing that I am mostly thinking about how to fix right now.
* All-company hackathon week is in 2 weeks and I have a dozen ideas. Much excite.
* There are blog posts that I plan to write, but have not yet. (jenkins nodes, retros)
