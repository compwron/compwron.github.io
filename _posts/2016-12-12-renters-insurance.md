I asked my friends on the internet whether I should get renters insurance, and here is what they said.

I did end up getting renters insurance through geico (assurant) for $17/month with a first payment of $24.34. http://www.myassurantpolicy.com/welcome-new EDIT: Then I switched to lemonade.com for $5/month

- If I had that kind of money, I wouldn't be renting?
- I hate it! It's like another annoying monthly membership
- it's cheap enough to not be a big deal (have at $60 a year)
Worth it. You never know when the apartment above you's shower will leak down through your ceiling... Or when your hardware grows legs and walks out of the apartment :/
- I had it. It's absolutely worth it. It's peace of mind and the price isn't bad.
- totally worth it!
- Smart
- Everyone keeps telling me to get it and I keep forgetting
- I keep meaning to get it and putting it off/forgetting. I'm told it might have offered some compensation when our bikes were stolen, though I've never looked into exactly what is and isn't covered.
It's awful nice to not start from nothing when you burn your house down. It pays off less than you'd think though. PM me if you want details.
- It's a no brainer.
- I pay like $200 a year for $21k in protection. Shit happens. Do the thing.
- Self-insurance is an option worth considering. If you have valuable items, might be worth insuring.
- Necessary evil.
- After seeing my garage catch on fire...I put it in high regard.
- If you get it, make sure you take photos of all your expensive stuff in case you need to make a claim.
- Generally, with insurance I ask myself the question: "Could I afford to replace this out of pocket if I had to?" Insurance is not a good bet statistically (or the insurers wouldn't make any money), so I only get the insurance if the answer is "yes".
- Not a bad idea if you live in a row home...or condo
- I love it. Has been totally worth it for me. I have assurant- pm me for personal story.
- recommend! gives us a peace of mind.
- Neutral - mandatory for last 2 places I've lived to provide $100k liability. Not expensive. Probably worth it.
- I work in management and leasing of residential, commercial, and self storage facilities. You should get renters insurance. Absolutely yes. If there was a fire and you didn't have renters insurance you would be financially in a bad spot.
- It's a good idea. Protect yourself.
- Definitely worth it for what it costs, and required the last couple places I rented.
- No one's talked much about the liability portion, but I find that to be the bigger benefit. Total replacement cost for all my possessions is fairly low, but possible liabilities for accidentally damaging others' stuff is uncapped.
- Totally uninformed.
- It's a good idea, but don't use it unless your entire apartment burns to the ground. I had a couple of thefts and claimed them on my renter's insurance...the company then decided they didn't want to sell me renter's insurance anymore...and then later decided they didn't want to sell me insurance when I was in the process of buying a house. Sooooo...just be careful with it.
- I believe some policies also cover theft outside of your home (like a car break-in).
- Essential, especially in earthquake territory.
- Renters insurance is quite inexpensive. It costs me only about $120. a year.
- I pay about $30 a month for R.I. and most importantly, it's liability coverage. besides that, I've had a few bikes stolen and they've covered that easily... Liability insurance means if someone, ummmm, slips and falls in my bathroom and breaks their arm, I am personally covered so that litigious person doesn't get at my bank account.
