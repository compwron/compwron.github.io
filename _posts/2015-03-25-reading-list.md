Today at lunch (for free- Kindle Unlimited is useful sometimes) I read [Learn To Hustle - The No BS Guide To Land A Startup Job Or Internship](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V565HJW) which I learned about from [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/learn-to-hustle-2). I do not particularly want to work for a startup. He gives advice that I believe would increase the chances of a reader to accomplish the stated goal.

This is something that I am sensitized to from elsewhere in the internet, but: one of the recommendations is 'work for free' and this reminds me a lot of [The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community).
