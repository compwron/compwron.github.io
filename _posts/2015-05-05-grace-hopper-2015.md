I haven't decided whether I'll attend (because yanno I've been before and there are other conferences to go to and the company only pays for so many of them), but I'm (trying to) sponsor some students from my old university to attend. I hope to update this post with the progress of that endeavor. 

Currently I have ack from the head of the department, two professors I trust to get things done, and a University Gift Representative who means well. As far as I know we are still at the "That's great! We will do some stuff and get back to you" stage.

I still have a deep distrust of the university's ability to disburse funds in a timely manner, so I'm insisting on handling the funding directly. I am interested in how this will work out. Also, according to my Secret Inside Spy (a friend who is still taking classes), no students know about this yet despite it being two weeks from first contact. The journey continues. 


	I'm an [X Uni] alumni currently working as a software developer. I would like to sponsor four [X Uni] students to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2015 conference (Houston, Oct14-16). Can you please connect me with someone who can help me coordinate this?

	Requirements:
	1. Identify as female
	2. Enrolled full time at [X Uni] during the current semester
	3. Taking at least one CS course during the current semester
	4. Attend the full day of all 3 days of the conference (Oct 14, 15, 16)
	5. After the conference, send me a 500-word writeup of your experiences

	Please tell students who are interested to email me at (email) before end of day 10 June 2015 with
	1. Name
	2. Grad/undergrad, year, current CS courses
	2. Under 250 words on why they are interested in attending the conference
	3. Please make the email subject message "[X Uni] Grace Hopper"

	On 11 June 2015, I will contact all [X Uni] students who have contacted me with a yes/no. 

	Reimbursement specifics:
	Receipts for airfare, hotel, and conference ticket must me emailed to me before I'll reimburse them. 
	- Hotel, 3 nights (1 room for 4 students). Up to $750 total (i.e $250 per night). AirBnb or other options ok. 
	- Airfare (up to $300 round trip per student)
	- Conference ticket (Early bird student ticket: $300)
	- $40 per day per student for misc. expenses (food, train, taxi)

	Reimbursement will be within 48 hours of when I get the receipt, and can be directly to the students or through an [X Uni] faculty intermediary. Reimbursement will be via paypal, venmo, squarecash, chase quickpay, or similar. 

	Please feel free to email me with any questions at (email)
