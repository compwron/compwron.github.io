The most frustrating part of job searching, for me, is that I can only work for one awesome company at a time, and the industry currently frowns upon stints of less than a year. Maybe this is why people go into freelancing? Anyway, for my future edification, here are the companies that are currently on my radar for a few years from now, and why (obviously there will be a lot more companies in the world a year or two or five from now)
