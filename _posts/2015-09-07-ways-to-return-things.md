Lately, for obvious reasons, I've been interested in what to attach to one's keys in order to get the best chance of someone returning them if I lose them again. Yanno.

You do not really want to put your address on your lost keys, because then it's blatantly obvious that someone can come by and let themselves in. I am not going to do that. So I want a middleman service.
