I recently got a chance to read a list of the favorite organizations of some people (mostly in San Francisco) and here is a summary

**Question:** What's an organization you love?

**Answers:** (moderately verbatim, minimal redaction)

# I don’t do a lot with them, but the existence of Lesbians Who Tech is extremely validating.
# The Children’s Tumor Foundation is very near and dear to my heart.
# The National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) changed my life for the better.
# DQ84 Al-Anon family groups. The groups can be problematic in ways, so I don't think they're for everyone, I was lucky in that I found some really healthy, secular groups.
# I’m volunteering for SF CASA and appreciating it! it’s an org supporting foster youth, and a lot of foster youth have PTSD
# Access Women's Health Justice [accesswhj.org](https://accesswhj.org)
# [Asian Women's Shelter](https://www.sfaws.org/)
# [Muttville Senior Dog Rescue](https://muttville.org/) Muttville's mission is to change the way the world thinks about and treats older dogs and to create better lives for them through rescue, foster, adoption, hospice, education, and advocacy.
# Sogorea Te' Land Trust (https://sogoreate-landtrust.com/) - a women-led indigenous group working towards returning the East Bay to indigenous stewardship. I pay their yearly land tax, and you can, too!
# Buffalo Field Campaign (https://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/) - a group founded by native folks and environmental activists, working towards saving the last couple thousand genetically pure, continuously wild plains bison. Most bison these days are actually interbred with cattle, and haven't been taught to migrate by their families because they're raised in captivity.
# Dykes with Drills (https://www.dykeswithdrills.com/) - what it sounds like! Workshops, meetups, and projects for folks that want to learn to build or already build.
# KPOO 89.7FM (http://www.kpoo.com/) - volunteer-run, non-profit/non-commercial community radio in SF featuring some of the most iconic local musicians, DJs, and programming, including live broadcasts of community meetings and the Coltrane Church "Uplift" broadcast every Tuesday from 12 noon to 4pm; they operate on a shoestring budget ($75k annually) and every donation really does matter
# Immigration Institute of the Bay Area (https://iibayarea.org/) - offers free and low-cost legal services (including deportation defense and DACA workshops) to immigrants in the region, as well as training/tutoring for citizenship exams; my spouse became a citizen a few years ago and we are fortunate to be able to donate the cost of at least one citizenship application fee to this org every year
# Immigrant Families Together (https://immigrantfamiliestogether.com/) - all-volunteer group of everyday citizens working to reunite families separated at the border, paying bonds and organizing transit from detention centers, paying living expenses, and generally offering rapid response help to traumatized families in a unique, horrifyingly necessary way [Immigration Institute of the Bay Area](https://iibayarea.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IIBA-Full-Name-.jpg)
