I went to a [talk about talking](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/writespeakcode-conference-talk-proposals-twitter-hq-tickets-16166042067) by [@wscsf](https://twitter.com/wscsf) where [@caitie](https://twitter.com/Caitie) spoke about speaking. Twitter hosted. Their lobby is not the most meetup-friendly place, but I do like their elevators. There was also another meetup about [automated testing in java](http://www.meetup.com/sfjava/events/220862630/) being hosted at the same time, although of course the office was more than big enough for all. (We never even saw them once we got upstairs.)

~20+ people attended- some coming late, some leaving early. 

There were three impromptu lightning talks before the main talk:

- ruby examples from my github 
- "Hero" programmers (with lego slides!)
    - "I am a responsibility sponge"
    - "You get bitten by a radioactive spider and now theres a repo you have to take care of or people will be mad at you"
    - "If you're not a hero, go find one, and save them"
- wordcount with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) by [@holdenkarau](https://twitter.com/holdenkarau)

Some interesting takeaways for me from the main talk:

- [Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) "a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications" (used in Halo 4)
- [Saga pattern](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:V7CI6OO1VmsJ:kellabyte.com/2012/05/30/clarifying-the-saga-pattern/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us): failure management pattern, also described in the book [SOA patterns](http://www.manning.com/rotem/)
    - "A saga is a long lived transaction that can be broken up into a collection of sub-transactions that can be interleaved w/ other transactions. Each sub transaction in the saga has a compensating transaction which from a semantic point of view undoes actions of the sub transaction" [source](https://twitter.com/caitie/status/579753897658462208)
- craftcon budapest! (next week)
- Tip for what to talk about: rip off talks that you wanted to be better! If you see a talk description that's like "omg so cool!" and the talk is like "eh" then write your own version of that talk. 
- After your talk is accepted, if you don't know yet
    - Ask how many hotel nights the conf covers. Expect the entire conference, + a day or weekend if it is a very long trip. 
    - If the conf travel allocation is not enough for your flight, messsage them and see if they can help.
    - Do not feel bad about asking for-profit conferences for nice things (politely!)
    - Will talks be streamed / recorded? (Make sure to be clear on this if you have preferences)
- If you are asked to fill "the woman/diversity speaker slot"
    - This can be insulting, of course
    - Take it if it is useful to you and you want to (travel, meeting other speakers, exposure)
    - If you can't / don't want to, recommend someone else if you feel like helping the conf out
- I like the speaker's style of fast speaking and deep technical content (in example presentation abstracts)
- "I don't know how speaker fees work, other than keynote slots..."
- [@callbackwomen](https://twitter.com/@callbackwomen) and [@techspeakdigest](https://twitter.com/@techspeakdigest)
- Speaking at meetups is a good way to get started. Meetup organizers frequently want speakers, are less prepared to support speakers than full conferences, ymmv
- summarize at the end of your talk so the audience knows when to clap
- have a thank you slide, then a questions slide (with your twitter handle if you are willing to talk to people)
- Preparing for a talk: "a month and a half of doing mostly this in my free time"
- [talk resources](https://github.com//kellyk/wsc-resources)
- What happens when people misuse/hog your Q&A time? "tech boy tantrums" loll
- Submit a talk on something that you want to know more about. If it gets accepted, you will learn a lot! (Only if you have time to do good research)

Post-presentation presentations:

- pitch deck from [Sentri](http://sentri.me/) - home monitoring
- Abstract for a talk on Apache Spark

There were a lot of people from the health industry for some reason (like ~25%!). Also, I am interested in talking more to the people who described themselves as "in civic tech" but not sure who they are.

"Well, I hate myself and these slides..."

I am not terribly excited about speaking, but I am decent at it and it is useful for career stuff (and I enjoy conferences)... mostly I attended this meetup 1. to see Twitter 2. for some brain variety 3. cool people
