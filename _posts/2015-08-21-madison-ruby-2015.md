[Madison Ruby](http://madisonpl.us/ruby/)

Why do I go to conferences? I am looking for the expanding of the mind. I want to hear about things I've never thought about before. After attending Madison+ Ruby... I really wish some of my (past, present, and future) coworkers were here.

Note: titles here represent what I remember the talk by, not any attempt at the real titles.

Ratings represent how much effort I personally would advise my past self to devote to travelling to the talk, given my post-talk total knowledge.

# Talks

What is life? [@nusco](https://twitter.com/nusco) *bike

- generated petri dish / evolution simulation (from genome!)
- "it crashed the screen. it was not supposed to be that smart."
- simulation includes energy - the sim dies if there is too little. Hunts for 'food' scattered on the petri dish.
- dnabrowser  .germfile
- "They [the generated organisms] take advantage of my bugs- in the physics engine. They exploit it." (Wasn't taking into account moments of inertia.)
- "This is the same process that created mold and penguins and trees and people."
- "This is the story of how I got emotionally attached to stick figures."
- [https://github.com/nusco/narjillos](https://github.com/nusco/narjillos)
- book: metaprogramming ruby 2


The Bronx (Stephanie Morillo, writer at DigitalOcean) *bike

- The vast majority of the people at this conference have ridden the NY city subway at least once.
- The demographics of train cars are fascinating- the one place where people from dramatically different parts of society spend time together daily.
- "The Bronx isn't burning. The bronx is invisible to people in the tech industry."
- StartupBox is an org teaching ppl underemployed people in the Bronx how to become game industry quality analysts
- "Tech is... monochromatic"
- "I am a 10x english syntax engineer!"
- "I start and end my commute with the people who clean the offices that I work in."
- "Show them what the commandline is. Take away the magic. Take the ninjas out of it."
- Presenter notes on the phone is cool. What app is she using? Is there a good one? I've seen others do this too.
- Don't shame people for learning to code and not getting work as developers. You can learn to code in order to become a better marketer or publicist! Especially at a tech firm or marketing to tech firms.
- "If you maintain a gem, a library, and you have documentation- hire a technical documenter. I might not use your gem, but I will understand the heck out of it!"
- Comparing diversity to getting up on the train when someone pregnant needs to sit: it doesn't invalidate your being-on-the-train-ness.
- How do you "do" diversity? Hire the people you don't hire. "...Let's start there." ... "Go to schools in your area that you don't source from." Rethink why you don't source there.
- Don't think of it as "the wrong side of town" think of it as potential energy.


Howto fix communications in one day *step

- Closed captioning youtube made an unexpectly huge business impact; the ramifications go well beyond acessibility.
- "filling a damaged pipeline is very frustrating." [The pipeline of women going into technical fields]
- [Skateistan](https://skateistan.com)
- [Harvard experiment detecting biases] https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
- This seemed to me like a generic "diversity is good" talk
- [list yourself as a woman speaker](http://speakerinnen.org)
- [(Berlin) Ruby Monday Study Group’stas](http://rubymonstas.org/)
- rails girls summer of code


Estimation (table XI, Noel Rappin [@noelrap](https://twitter.com/noelrap)) *walk

- Understudy speaker!!! (This is a cool conference idea. Do all conferences do this? What do you do with the understudy/backup speakers that don't have to perform?)
- "How far do you live from an airport?" twenty minutes (by car, weather, not rush hour...)
- [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/noelrap/i-estimate-this-talk-is-20-minutes-give-or-take-10)
- Boston Big Dig overpass
- [Site](http://www.noelrappin.com/)
- [Book](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1941222196)
- Explans feature, story, iteration, point, velocity
- This talk re-convinced me that points are useful, even for my current team.
- "If they were precise, we would call them measurements. They are probabilistic."
- "If the weatherman says there is a 50% chance of rain tomorrow, and it doesn't rain, was the weatherman wrong? We can't tell. You have to measure over time." "Weathermen overestimate rain, beeacuse if he says it'll rain and it doesn't, people are happy. The other way, and they're pissed off. There may be a relation to software development here." (crowd laughs)
- Implies paypal is not easy to integrate with. Interesting. I thought that they were.
- "If you have pressure to fake estimates, the culture is toxic and you should leave. If possible."
- "You want it by [next month]? Sure, I can produce an estimate that does that." (crowd laughs)
- "The map is not the terrain." (my favorite slide of this talk)
- "Avoid false precision. Just because you divide two numbers by each other and get five decimal places, that doesn't mean that those decimal places are meaningful." YES THIS
- It is toxic to reference variable time per developer in estimation. There is a time and place for individual developer evaluation, and estimations are not it.


Lunch - There was $20 cash in each swag bag, and you went out with newly-met people and bought local food. This worked well. 90 min for an unhurried lunch. Networking encouragement, giving back to community, etc.


Ditching the single page application *step

- Types of app: traditional, pjax/turbolinks, traditional.

Evening expeditions: dinner (pick your own adventure) followed by the local childrens museum, complete with hamster wheel. Very cool.

Sunday:


In the morning: farmers market! Tasty. Having been to farmers markets in three or four states, this one is one of the most impressive I've seen. Lots of bakeries, cheese, maple, jerky, vegetables. Not much fruit right then. The traffic flow is pretty much one way, so if you want to backtrack you will be swimming upstream. (It is a circle around the capitol building)


Backstage tour!


Rails girls lightning talk

- finite element analysis
- [Slides](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2015/08/22/madison-ruby-and-parallella/)


Surgical refactoring *bike

- I disagree that changing code solely in order to increase application speed is "refactoring". Speed is a feature. (Non-functional requirement.)
- There are types of refactoring. cosmetic refactoring vs required-for-next-feature refactoring.
- "just grab me at the afterparty" errr hopefully not literally and also who does that?
- yay live testing onscreen!
- "Yay! @nellshamrell shows its ok to write tests that “smell” in order to get valid coverage when preparing to refactor #MadPlusRuby" (tweet)
- None of this is new to me, but seeing someone else run through refactorings is actually really great. I hadn't realized how much this would be intersting to me, to see someone's exact style even when it is almost exactly the style that I also use.

- "There is no hindering progress. We could try but I think we would fail."
- Empathy "How does your job affect the lower 80%, and how do you feel about that?"


Immutable infrastructure ([Craig Buchek](https://twitter.com/craigbuchek)) *bike

- TIL https://rawgit.com/
- Audience member ducks onstage during the talk to grab their yoga-leftover waterbottle and phone and it is not weird (only at M+R)
- Who here is doing software-defined networking? Only one hand goes up. I would expect a lot more than that- maybe it is audience composition.

He Doesn't Work Here Any More (trans-itioning in the tech industry) by Coraline Ada *hike

- Puberty is already pretty terrible. "Imagine going through puberty... for the wrong sex." (audience flinches)
- "Puberty is permenant."
- It can be very comfoting to get your mind into the intellectual bubble. Outside feels don't hurt there.
- unluckygirl screenname
- "It felt like falling down a mountain"
- choosing names!
- valleygirl accent
- la vie en rose (a very good movie about transitioning)
- aaron yay!
- Organization: lgbtech
- bbeditor lol
- "I came out like any good geek would- via gist"
- Current company: instructure. Cool!
- "I had to learn to listen - a skill I'd never really developed as a male"
- Project - Open Source for Women
- "I've learned that, when you're not fucking miserable all the time, (stuff)" This hit me in the feels
- "And now I fucking own my SEO [search engine optimization]"
- opalgate, "online oss princess of the month" omg wtf the internet O.o
- Spoke at 14 conferences last year, 13 this year so far. Wow!
- Metadata in communication!
- "They were happy; their headers matched."
- pronouns
- "You wouldnt tell a poor person- money is just a social construct! It's just paper!"
- Lessons Learned(crossout) Learning
- It's never too late to learn empathy
- To me, this was the best presentation just for pure presenting power. You could hear the hush in the room. Even note-taking laptop screens dimmed to black, phones went face-down (but held ready for slide photos)


# Overall/Misc thoughts:

- Relatively little of this was new to me, and I am here for the new. (Someone in the coffee room was telling me about how zomg they were to see refactoring done in the way it was done on the screen. I am very glad about this.)
- It was really nice to see people I recognized at a tech conference. This has only begun to happen to me very recently.
- Travelling with someone who knows lots of people really changes my conference experience
- People in the front row were using the stage as a foot-place. That was adorable. It was a "family" con.
- This was a remarkably diverse conference, especially for ruby (I have occasionally been the only lady at 40+ person ruby meetups in SF/Chicago)
- I love that this is a supportive enough environment that an MC who occassionally stutters is met with support and love.
- At a break, someone described M+B to me as "Half ruby at best". I agree that there was not 100% ruby-code-on-screen talks. As the last year of the conference, maybe they wanted to use it for its most useful purpose. I am totally ok with this. IMO, the website gave fair warning. In general I prefer strongly technical talks, but this was a god experience.
- I am glad that I left for the airport before the ending-emotions singalong/group onstage hug/?
- Attrition over the course of the day was pretty marked on Saturday. Probably hallway track / balcony seating?
- There were five backup speakers! ...How does that work?
- Someone (in the audience) had written the raffle app. It was pretty cool. Better than names from hat. :)
- There were relatively few people not in my generation in attendance.
- I don't like "pipeline" as a descriptor for (women in) tech. Pipelines have an end, and it is CEO. I want to stay by the second joint of the pipeline.
- I have an allergic reaction to "spread the word"
- Sending students from my old university to this conference would have been a good return on investment. ...Maybe OSfeels confernce would work. Something near Chicago. Hmm.


# TODOs for me

- [Harvard experiment detecting biases](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)
- Send this post to R to make them jealous. Give R his cool M+R shirt.



# Humans I had seen before (yay!!) or chatted with onsite (also yay!)

- Braintreep!
- Ray of Chicago Ruby meetup
- J.<3 (Chicago Ruby)
- cczona (also &:conf)
- Claire! (Chef)
- Coroline Ada!
- 3 &:conf humans! :)

- Dude who works for GE, "mostly devlops puppet/chef stuff"
- Githubber (campfire/hipchat/slack/irc discussion)
- Dude in the coffee room going zomg about the refactoring talk
- famousish ruby dude


# Idle thoughts: If I put on a conference, some of the talks would be...

- A talk on advanced refactoring, with examples (just like like M+R)
- Overview of recent diversity incidents in tech, with maybe a smattering of background (reference resources like Geek Feminism wiki etc)
- Overview of the speaker's favorite non-household-name startups of the last X years, with musings on the what-how-why of startups
- Live demo where someone from the audience brings up a random computer without ruby installed and the speaker has to try to install ruby on it. Start with an easy one and then keep going until you're out of time. Narrate.
- Overview of ways to environment, tools, approaches, current 'best' (ansible, chef, puppet, docker, related tools)
- Deep dive into current docker use cases
- Deep dive into current bundler/rubygems ecosystem (ilke Andre did at AirBnB)-  pay via donation to RubyTogether?
- Basic social justice and feminism overview, principles of
- Overview of recent incidents, and discuss resources- probably use parts of the geek feminism wiki as source material
- Coroline Ada's talk from M+R!
- Several talks encouraged about cool recent applications of ruby (space, medical science, government, ??)
- Several talks of discussion/walkthrough of an interesting current library (rspec, devise, or something smaller / niche)
- (not a talk) Make a mailing list for speakers before the conf! To ask questions to.
