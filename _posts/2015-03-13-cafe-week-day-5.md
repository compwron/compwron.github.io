I mucked about with some [code eval](https://www.codeeval.com/profile/compwron/) problems, primarily for the lulz. They are entertaining. The short ones are under ten minutes; the 'Hard' ones can take quite a while- more time than I wanted to give today.

I looked up and recorded the syntax for what I think of as ["nested parameters for enumerable block"](https://gist.github.com/compwron/00c94fc3b92bff925d25 ) in ruby.

Followed some [basic rails tutorials](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/) (see bottom) to see what is new in the world (and what non-heavily-customized rails projects look like) and made a [todo app](https://github.com/compwron/todoapp).

Read some stuff about code on the internet.

Approximate working hours: 10:30am - 7pm, cafe and home, long lunch, life tasks, etc.

Thus concludes [Cafe Week](https://trello.com/b/rKOfAgEt/cafe-week).
