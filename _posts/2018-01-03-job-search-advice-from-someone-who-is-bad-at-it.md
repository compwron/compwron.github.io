title: "Job Search Advice From Someone Who is Bad At It"

Mostly, my advice is to not do it the way that I do.

Some things that I do advocate for-

* If at all possible, have a **public / open job search**. You will probably have to leave your prior job first in order to do this while not feeling super weird. It increases your options hugely. It is a big risk unless you have good savings. And it can be super depressing if it takes longer than you expect. But... you will be able to talk to so many more people and make a much more informed decision
* **Be really clear with yourself** (in private) about why you are leaving a job, and what you want in your next job.
* **It is okay to have mixed feelings about leaving a job.**
* **It is good to talk about money!** Maybe after the onsite though. (You can always check Glassdoor though)
* Don't tell a recruiter how much money you make; **tell them what you *want*.**
* **If you have a bad/weird experience with a particular recruiter**, or they are rude, or somehow rub you the wrong way- maybe interview with a different company. At a minimum, think about why that particular thing runs you the wrong way. Are you thinking "are they assuming that I'm lying?" or "how much free time do they think I have??" or just "wow, that guy is way perkier than I enjoy interacting with". If you decide to disengage with that company/recruiter, consider doing them the favor of telling the recruiter your concerns (politely).
* **Make a spreadsheet** for your search! Mine is in google sheets, and has columns like company name, city/neighborhood, status (see below),  people I know there, and then columns about offers, to track base pay, signing bonus, options, other benefits like 40k etc. Also a column for the original job ad, and for the urls of emails I've sent to the recruiter or to myself with my interview notes, like "interviewer Bob said that what makes someone successful here is attention to detail- what does that mean?"
* **References-** in your spreadsheet, have a separate section with the info (name, email, phone number, company worked together at) of all your references. Make sure to check with your references so they are never surprised by people contacting them! When you are done with your job search, tell your references! And thank them for being willing to be "on call" on your behalf. :)
* **Find a way to forgive yourself for the great offers that you can't take.** I want to work at all of these cool companies, and I can't. If it helps, think of it as making the best choices for your good friend, Future You, who right now needs someone to handle their shit, because they are exhausted and emotionally drained and on a gut level deeply convinced by their onsite that this is The One despite X, Y, and Z. (I am not good at this yet)

For ease of reading my own spreadsheet, here are the categories that I have for "status"

* 0 not started (no contact- for companies I am interested in but haven't engaged with yet)
* 1 pending phone screen
* 2 pending remote tech screen
* 3 pending onsite
* 4 post-onsite
* /- noped (interview process has been stopped, by them or by me)
