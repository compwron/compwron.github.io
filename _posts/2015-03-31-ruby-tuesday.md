I went to Ruby Tuesday this week (at Heroku)

Excellent food (bacon-wrapped prunes, chcoolate mousse, little pastry things)

TIL [GHC](http://gracehopper.org/) does not pay for the tickets of speakers O.o

Talk 1 (lightning talk, common security vulns), speakers: [Daed](https://twitter.com/unda3d) and [hypatia](https://twitter.com/hypatiadotca)

Interesting links

Talk 2 (presenting at conferences - things you didn't know - way beyond how to present), speakers: [cczona](https://twitter.com/cczona) and [micheletitolo](https://twitter.com/micheletitolo)

"Now we are demonstrating how sometimes ear mics don't stay on" lol

"Conferences kind of suck at communicating that they exist" - look at [Callback Women](http://www.callbackwomen.com/home.html) - a resource for conference organizers trying to find speakers and speaker-interested people trying to find conferences. [donate](https://gratipay.com/CallbackWomen)

Email (or any private rather than public communication) someone who has been to / spoken at the conference before... sometimes they will tell you "yay!" and sometimes they will ... tell you a story ...

Put everything that you actually depend on in your carry-on

Have your slides under version control, accessible from multiple locations and multiple machines, and on a flash drive. Bring a mac-VGA adapter, a remote, thunderbolt cord, ethernet connector, chapstick.

Funny stories: 


For a speaker conferences should:

- pay for your travel (If the conference is cranky about travel expenses, you might not want to hang out with them anyway)
- pay for your ticket (GHC and PyCon don't do this, but PyCon has a financial aid system)


"It is totally ok to have personal motives for speaking at conferences ... perfectly crass and cynical and works out great for everybody"

- travel? (internationally too!!)
- networking?
- people offering you interesting opportunities you would have never heard of otherwise?


For a speaker, your employer should:

- NOT take it out of your 'time off'
- Be proud!
- Probably ask you to put a "<Logo> is hiring!" slide into your presentation


How I personally feel about speaking at conferences:

- Generally grumpy but capable
- Travel is nice (but I strongly prefer to travel with friends or to a place where I know other people)
- Slides as code are fun to make

"It was a FIVE MINUTE talk; what makes you think that I can write a book on this??" #realLife
