title: "Code Name Origins"

I'm interested in the origins of the names of code projects, from libraries to languages. I have a theory that many of them are based on wordplay about their domain and other libraries that they interface with. The naming of these things is a usually-unnoticed reference to events not known by the majority of people who use them every day. [Tell me about yours!](https://twitter.com/compiledwrong/status/697220859161739264) No code is too big or too small.

## [pyrst](https://github.com/zackmdavis/pyrst_collections)

## [Poise](https://github.com/poise)

Origin: Thematically related to "Balanced" (the name of company that the author was working at, at the time, and it was unclear how related this would be to their brand). Unlikely to overlap with other things in the namespace. Available toplevel domain, available name on pypi and rubygems and npm. Found by thesaurus search for "balance". The only major name collision at the time was an australian tampon manufactuer. No, you are not legitimately confused.
