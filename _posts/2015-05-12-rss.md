I am slowly building [a list of rss feeds](https://github.com/compwron/rss-feeds) that I can-and-want-to keep up with in [Leaf](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leaf-rss-news-reader/id576338668?mt=12). I am going for having lots of low-volume high-value, rather than a firehose. Slashdot and hackernews are part of my habits in a different way. My goal here is to improve the long tail of time that I spend on the little sites that I check when I remember to, or when something they post makes it to a larger news source. I'm trying to hook myself into more original sources and local sources, rather than paying any attention to most of buzzfeed.


People name their feeds the darnedest things - probably usually forgetting to set the default to not be 'RSS' or 'Feed' but also sometimes 'Engineering Blog' (rather than CompanyName Engineering etc)
