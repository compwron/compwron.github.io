I was delayed in Toronto (caught the 8am to Montreal rather than the 7am) due to weather. Missed a keynote.
I have notes because that is how I prefer to listen to talks.

Notes:

- slides using pypyjs?
- [Astrophysics source code library](http://ascl.net/)
- [code.nasa.gov](http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2014/10/06/code-nasa-gov-and-empowering-the-open-source-community/)
- ipython wraps fortran, timeit
- "This is probably how all of us configured our first server." Have I ever had a 'first server'? Have I ever 'configured a server'? What counts as 'configuring'? What counts as a 'server'? I have done lots of things that could be said to be that thing... But none that are what I think that he means. 
- "The video of my ... talk from this morning is up" <- this is AMAZING. Pycon does this right. 
- talk title is important :/ 
- "Confusion is a sign that you're about to learn something." also frustration
- "He read a lot of comics. For you. You're welcome."
- @astrokiwi to @brandon_rhodes: Would you be interested in an astronomy open space this #pycon? Thinking of posting one
- Bought pycon hoodie; most likely to use frequently. Also considered laptop sleeve. 
- science... it's gotta be python. numpy, scipy.
- @EleonoreMayola "Yes! It happened! I queued for women's toilets at a programming conference!"
- I want to see a lightning talk on 'best current slidemaking code tools'
- What osx calendar app can I schedule events on from the commandline? Like "$ calendar MTW recur 5wks" or something. Internet is failing me. https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/events/quickAdd


Reviewing things:

This could be a separate post someday. Those weird things next to the star next to talk titles (actually topics, not titles- something for me to remember, not something to find it by) are ratings. Actually, I hate the word 'ratings'. I want to rate talks, but A-F is bad because some talks I don't like. Same for 1-5; assigning numbers to this is disingenuious because what are you measuring? There is more than one axis. My ratings are basically how much effort I would tell my prior self to go to in order to see it. It is a very personalized-to-me rating. (The [LT] is for "lightning talk".) This is a combination of content depth, presenter style, and how I feel about the topic matter. I tend to like fast-paced talks that go into the "why" of the topic and also into the "how". I tend to like talks with code on screen.


I also happened to attend the PSF yearly members meeting (guest, not member). Good food, good conversation. 


Things that pycon gets right:

- finaid
- fast video posting
- code of conduct, enforcement and handling
- TWO podiums for lightning talks (so next speaker can set up during current speaker)
- real-time audio captioning
- the sprints sound really cool
- a keynote you can tweet during! (good internet)
- Good transit notes on the website. Good wifi network name. 

TODO (for me)

- get better with ruby debugging tools- remember how you felt about other developers who used println instead of debugging in java? Like that. 
- Next pycon, make an astronomy open space first thing! https://twitter.com/astropy

People run into:

- Venmo people!!
- Two people in BT hoodies who recognized me in passing and waved
- Lady who was also on the 747 bus I rode (got finaid grant, work miiight have sent her, 'I do as much python as [work] will let me')
- BT Adam
- Ross from PS1
