Here are some thoughts on my New Years -esque resolutions and how they are going. My approach to these is- it doesn't bother me too much to skip a day, but I try to always always come back to it.

Write in a (private, searchable) journal every day. I feel like this helps me remember what life used to be like, and gives me more perspective on whether any particular emotional low or high is actually low or high, and whether I have ever felt that type of terrible before, and how long it might take to recover, and what might help. This is useful to me. I like introspection and I like extending my memory. I'm averaging maybe 60% of days and I hope to improve.

Write one work of fiction every day. I got this inspiration from (link to Brienne when I have internet) and I really like the output. Even the mediocre sci fi outputs of my brain are interesting to me in retrospect, taken as a whole and inspected as a commentary. I am keeping these in a google doc. I'm averaging a little worse here than I am at journaling; I try to do them together, but I tend to prioritize the journaling. My brain does tend to generate story snippets, especially when I'm on the train or walking from the train to work

Listen to a podcast every day (in order to get better at consuming audio/visual media). For personal historical reasons, I don't really watch much audio/visual media- tv or movies or youtube videos. This is going pretty well, especially because in the afternoons at work (BC, not TW) it is very silent and I wear one half of my headphones and listen to Ruby Rogues or Ruby Tapas or Changelog or whatever. I'm trying to listen to at least one totally new podcast-ish thing or informational youtube video. I feel like this is benefiting me in some way, even when I listen to something that I disagree with. Maybe especially then.

I had hoped to revisit a previous project- read at least one chunk of (non-ruby) code every day, but I'm not currently trying to do that or tracking it.
