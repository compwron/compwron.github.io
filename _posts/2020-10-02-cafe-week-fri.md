#### CASA

Review and merge PRs, including a bootcamper's first OSS PR (not bad!). Gemfile cleanup, help w merge conflicts. Upgrade yarn deps and test it didn't break things. 

#### [Merit](https://www.get-merit.com/) mentoring call

A second 45 min call with a different person, getting more advice about eng, management, and eng management. I have been very impressed with merit so far! It was easy to schedule a session with a mentor and the two people I spoke to were both very cool experienced people and I got a lot out of talking to them. I'm not sure where they get their money tho...   

The person I spoke to actually used to be on a team that my future boss managed, AND worked with someone who I worked with a few jobs ago! What a wild and excellent coincidence. Tech feels very small sometimes.

We talked about different styles of eng management like "architect / eng safety net", "developer/encourager of people",
