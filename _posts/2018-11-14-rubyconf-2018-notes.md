Talks I've attended, with some light irrelevant commentary:

## Day 1:
1. Keynote by Matz! [recording](https://youtu.be/_YU_gIEPABQ)
2. [The Games Developers Play](http://rubyconf.org/program#session-706)
3. [Designing an engineering team](http://rubyconf.org/program#session-669) Jack Danger, former Square, is a really great speaker and I really like the points he makes about how you want multiple knowledge specialites on an eng team. This is a talk that I will send the recording to my team, and rewatch it myself.
4. [Yes, You Should Provide a Client Library For Your API](http://rubyconf.org/program#session-689) [slides](http://daniel-azuma.com/articles/talks/rubyconf-2018) The head of google API clients talks about the great smart things you can build into an api client, and how google and other big companies generate these libraries for the huge matrix of APIs and languages that they are needed for. This is a topic I have some previous exposure to through the Braintree SDK team but this talk is great and pretty mindblowing imo
5. [Uncoupling systems](http://rubyconf.org/program#session-671)
6. [Ethical Data Collection for Regular Developers](http://rubyconf.org/program#session-664) This talk was a little intense and very real-world. The offical talk description really says it all: "The DC Abortion Fund collects extremely sensitive data about people seeking abortions. That's terrifying for the engineering team, who are responsible for keeping client data safe! We've made a lot of carefully measured ethical decisions about data intake and usage." The speaker discussed how in the current climate including ICE raids, they have stopped gathering immigration status data (and purged the old data) because even though that data helps them give clients much better service, the risk of subpoena is much too great.
7. Keynote by Bianca Escalante [recording](https://youtu.be/_YU_gIEPABQ) I liked that this was a keynote- she spoke about the responsibility of society and the most secure members of society to help, specifcally to help homeless people. She gave some great lists of organizations that are doing good in the world- I want to find her slides.

## Day 2:
