12 Oct Email from Hiring manager to schedule a phone call fo rlater that day. 3pm call, later that day- invited to start the API project
account, api access, try to build this project. one sentence spec
didn't finish, got oauth done
2 days later, schedule hackathon 21-23rd
between- went through django tutorials

dbmigrations all day, wasted
weekend no hackathon
bonus day 26th to make up for migrations
presented project to about half the engineering team + COO
lots of positive feedback, impressed by it and aA projects
2 days later, notified by COO that the HR lady would be in contact "in a couple days"
5 days later the HR manager sais the CEO would be "circling in" on a decision today
2 days later, pinged the HR manager, no response
5th Nov (next day) was told that there was an investor meeting scheduled the 6th of Nov and they'd have a decision for me by then
28th Oct - 5th Nov
this was not hte case. 10th Nov (5 days later) - email from HR manager, want to set up a phone call with you and the CEO (no other details)
Later on the 10th, response from head backend guy- we all liked you, ejoyed having you in for the hackathon, and now it's up to the CEO
11th Nov at 12:40pm call scheduled for 11th at 5pm (same day)
1:30 they asked to reschedule for the 13th at 4pm. At 4pm I called the CEO (as requested), asked to bump it back to 430 so we could talk while he was waling home from the office.
All told about a month
Conversation: not a conversation. he talked at great length about the misgivings they had about me and what a great experience this is for me, about the experience gap, he told me that I "wasn't good enough" for a full time position, that the feedback consensus was that I would need a lot of mentoring (true), no CS degree, no work exp in dev (except for UIC), did good work at the hackathon, protential but skill gap. No specific skills to improve- "ask the engineers" "experience builder" "low risk" (for them- implied) "Maybe if they were bigger they could bring me on as a " "only so many bullets to fire"
25/hr biweekly, any overtime cleared by him directly, implied 60k/yr with 5-10 hr of overtime. When they find someone that they feel strongly about, they try to get back to them quickly. (implication: not me.) 3-6 mo trial, perf review after 90 days, working on specific projects, the scope would not be so different from a full time eng. If they like, then maybe full time. Or sep ways. Minimum salaried employee, 80k+ before overtime. can only do paid overtime up to that point?
decision process "holistic", 5-6 ppl, usually the CEO sits in on hackathon (wat)

make a google calendar for this?
