My opinions have changed.

* Bees: from childhood pain+fear to adult "yay, I'm glad they're doing well (in the aggregate abstract)" and adult ability to hold still and wave them away gently instead of flailing when approached by bees.
* Spinach: from childhood "grosssss" to adult "not bad with the right salad dressing, goes well in homemade omelets"
* Money: from childhood "ooh, money is cool, I want more of it!" to adulthood "I wish this crap mattered less"
