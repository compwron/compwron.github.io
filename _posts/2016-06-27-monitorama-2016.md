Here are some blathering links. I would write up something real, but conferences are exhausting and I am going to be a puddle for a few days so sorry.

The swag was pretty great. Lots of tshirts. None in womens sizes, but eh

Before the first conf talk, the photographer was shooting me and some people I was chatting with, and I stepped aside and told him "please dontphotogrph me" and he appeared to understand and stop.

There was no code of conduct announcement in the conference introduction. (There was the second day, but not on the third day)

Here are some links and thoughts:
