title: "Thoughts on slow rails test suites"

I have joined yet another company with a slow rails test suite (2+ hr to run locally, ~15min to run on a CI server). Maybe there is no other kind. In addition, the OSS project I maintain, which is just ~8mo old, has a test suite that takes ~4 min to run locally. All of this seems excessive and I am not resigned yet.
