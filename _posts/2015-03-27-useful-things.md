[Donated to Rails Girls](../../../img/railsgirls.png)

Submitted the ruby-sanity-hacks talk to [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/)

Got lunch with a former coworker who is now at a startup, and her coworker who I met through another friend independantly, talked tech.

Got brunch with friend-of-friend developers in town for [chefconf](https://www.chef.io/chefconf/), found out that one of them is consulting for the same company that I am currently working for, chatted tech etc.
