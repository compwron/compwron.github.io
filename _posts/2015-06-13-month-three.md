My delight span for new (non-spaceflight) domains, previous testing has shown, is about 90 days. That is about how long it takes me to go from "wow, what does that crazy domain term mean??" to "ok, so a Foo can Frajble a Bar but only if it has been previously Blerged a Baz, but what about X? Arrrrgh, X"

Themes this month:

* Tech debt identification and cleanup
* Big coordinations with other teams
* Weird bugs, concurrency
* Timezones
* I've been 'handyman' twice in four weeks and even though it was my idea and the best idea for my schedule, it is still draining.
* Testing ruby with java O.o
* Hipchat being flaky/broken (but still getting the job done)

Fun moments:

* "can you ELI5 what a pull request is and does" (from someone not on the development team)

Quotes:

* '@here what does "failed permanently" mean?'
* "operation fix our shit"
* "I will keep an eye out for lack of tomatoes on pull requests"
* flaming bodhran!!
* "Facebook gatekeeper is the north star for features flag management"
* "tell me that's not prod"
* "I don't think that the naming matters unless it conveys the meaning"
* "We can talk about what I think, and then we can talk about what you think"
* "As some of you may have already found, new locks have been placed on the restroom doors" Basically never what I want to hear
* "don't think of it as a password / even though that's what it is / it's a two part API key"
* "I only add the @ignore if you pay me in unmarked bills first"
* "I can't imagine a migration causing the whole database to be dropped."
* "Why is that normal?"
* "This is only the code, I will now work on adding tests"


Pet peeves

* "bang it out" [urbandictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bang+it+out&defid=5499936) "To do the job quickly, and cheaply, cutting lots of corners along the way. The finished work appears shabby and unprofessional. Phrase is frequently used by amateurs."
* Comparing your coworker to a Pantene commercial
* "I'm glad you were able to find something to comment on there" on a comment on a PR


Best code I've seen:

* Can't show it here, but there is some stuff about testing the contents of migrations which is fun
