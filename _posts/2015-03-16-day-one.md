Decent onboarding.

10am: arrive Palo Alto office (a ten-minute walk off the California Caltrain stop), get laptops, set up some stuff
10:30: legal & HR presentation, I9
11:30: walk to the other building, get tour, get lunch
12:00: Technical stuff presentation: wiki, github, hipchat, many docs
2:00: get badge
I took the train back to SF (there were lots of Bart delays)
4:55pm arrive at SF office, say hi to people, sit at my new desk and run through setup stuff
6:00 leave to go to previous commitment (lots of the team was still there- apparently the dev day starts after 10am)

Things I especially liked:

- I made two github pull requests today (typos in onboarding docs)
- friendly people
- the 'lounge' room and 'mothers' room

Other stuff:

- No 401k matching (yet)
- the 'get admin' script


Unrelated TIL:

- To clear all alarms on an android phone rather than doing them one by one, Settings > Apps > Clock > Clear All Data
- To make single-linebreaks in jekyll, end the line with two (or more) spaces. I guess I need to mod my 'save/push' hook that strips whitespeace...
